"One means by the term botanical geography the methodical study of facts relating to the distribution of plants on the globe, and of more or less general laws that can be deduced from them.",
"This branch of human knowledge could excite attention of observers only since geography and botany, enriched by a great number of facts, could elevate themselves to general ideas.",
“The ancient naturalists very much neglected the study and even the indication of homelands of plants [indication des patries des plantes].”
“Linnaeus is the first who thought of indicating them in general works;”
“he is the first who gave the guideline and model of the manner of directing the [study of] plant life;”
"he is above all the first who distinguished carefully habitations, that is to say the countries in which plants grow and stations, that is to say the particular nature of localities in which they are in the habit of growing.",
“It is thus from Linnaeus that the first ideas of botanical geography emerged.”
"Since his time, all botanists have indicated with more precision the country of plants, and some have even made this study the object of their special researches.",
"Thus, Giraud-Soulavie, in his Histoire naturelle de la France méridionale, published in 1783, and Bernardin de Saint-Pierre, in his elegant Études de la nature, presented in this respect some interesting considerations, but lacking exactitude which demands attention from savants and which alone certifies truth.",

"To these diverse works must be added, to have a complete idea of the current state of our knowledge, this immense multitude of notes concerning the country of plants that one finds scattered in the writings of travelers, in the collections of naturalists, in the flora and general works of botany;",
"I will dare to add here that, by the manner I have recapitulated these notes in the Système universel du règne végétal, they will become more useful in the future for the study of the distribution of plants on the globe.",
"Such are the works which constitute the library of botanical geography, and of which this article must be a summary:"" ",
"I will add considerations which came to me through the attentive examination during my seven-year travel in France, regarding the distribution of plants on the land that surrounds us.",
"I propose to publish shortly the vegetable statistics of France, which will contain, among other results from my voyages, the collection of facts observed on the distribution of wild and domesticated plants on the surface of France.",
"The present article can be considered as the introduction of that work.",
"The whole science seems to me as classified under three general heads:",
"1.° Influence that external elements exercise on plants, and modifications which result, for each species, from the need it has of each substance, or from the means by which it can avoid its action;",
"2.° Consequences which result from these general data for the study of stations;",
"3.° Examination of habitations of plants, and consequences which result from it regarding the system of the science.",
"We must examine here the influence of temperature, light, water, soil, and atmosphere, and not lose the sight that, although for clarity of exposition we must separate them, they act almost all at the same time.",
"Of all these influences, the most pronounced is temperature.",
"This action is so clear that it is known to everyone, and by analyzing it I only classify the facts that are mostly trivial.",
"The temperature influences plants, whether by a purely physical action on their liquids and solids, or by a physiological action on their vital force.",
"Considered in its purely physical action, the temperature dilates or condenses plant parts, like those of all bodies.",
"The influence on the solids is little visible;",
"that on the liquids is so evident that one can conclude that the physical action of temperature on plants or plant parts is markedly proportional to the quantity of aqueous liquids contained in them.",
"Thus, the organs which do not contain any liquid are indifferent to extreme coldness or hotness:",
"such are the woods in their perfect state, and the seeds that are completely mature.",
"From this results that the seeds can be occasionally transported by some causes to the climates entirely different from theirs, and preserve their life there where the plants themselves would perish.",
"But, in order to analyze the effects of temperature on the liquids of plants, one must distinguish those which are outside of the plants and destined to penetrate them, and those which are already introduced into plant tissue.",
"All materials with which plants nourish themselves are either water or the substances dissolved or suspended into water.",
"If temperature is below the freezing point, the water that has become solid cannot penetrate into the plant tissue, and vegetation is suspended:",
"if temperature is too high, the ground becomes dry and can no longer provide aliments.",
"The first cause of sterility is observed at the pole and in high mountains;",
"the second cause in very hot places.",
"But the action of temperature is very perceptible at the surface of the ground, and less so at a certain depth:",
"from this results, 1) in a given terrain, the plants with deep roots resist better extreme temperatures than those with superficial roots;",
"2) a given plant resists better extreme temperatures in a terrain that is more dense or less conductive of caloric, or less endowed with the radiating faculty.",
"3) Given the nature of plants and that of terrain, the plants resist better coldness in a dry atmosphere, and hotness in a humid atmosphere.",
"As for the liquids contained in the very tissue of the plant, they are subject to the general laws of physics.",
"Coldness can make them reach the freezing point;",
"and as freezing is always accompanied by expansion, it breaks the walls of cells or vessels when freezing is sudden, and thus leads to the partial death of plants.",
"If, on the contrary, the heat is extreme, it leads to a severe evaporation, from which follows withering and drying up.",
"Let’s see by which mechanisms plants can more or less resist these effects.",
"Their resistance against freezing is based on the progress of their nutrition.",
"Their roots are plunged into the ground whose temperature is warmer in winter than that of the air:",
"thus they absorb, although in small quantity, a liquid which, by introducing itself into their tissue, warms the tissue to the point that the interior of big trees is in general of the same degrees of temperature as that indicated by a thermometer placed at the average depth of their roots.",
"This action proceeds to the summit, since the liquids do not communicate their heat from molecule to molecule, and since they can transmit heat only slowly to the substances that are ligneous/woody and not very conductive.",
"Thus a conflict incurs between the external coldness of the atmosphere and the internal heat of the sap.",
"The differences from one tree to another have to do essentially with more or less great facility with which the heat can be dispensed.",
"Thus, 1° the more the number of layers interposed and distinct by the zones of captive air increases between sapwood (which, containing more humidity, is more susceptible to freezing) and the exterior, the more the trees will be able to resist coldness:",
"thus, likewise, old trees resist coldness better than young trees (footnote: Young azedarach tree freezes often in Montpellier at 3~4 degrees, and I saw its mature version survive coldness of 15° without perishing in the botanical garden of Geneva);",
"likewise the birches, whose bark presents a great number of superimposed epidermis, resist coldness astonishingly;",
"likewise most of monocotyledon trees, lacking barks, fare worse in cold climates than the dicotyledons;",
"likewise the young sprouts resist coldness far better when, in their initial development, they are accommodated with flaky buds than when they are naked, etc.",
"2° The more the external layers lack water and are abundantly equipped with carbonized or resinous materials, the more the plants resist coldness:",
"thus, fatty plants freeze rather easily;",
"thus the conifers resist bitter coldness, while the non-resinous green trees freeze in less cold temperatures;",
"thus young sprouts, imbibed with water in spring, freeze at temperatures that they would normally survive in autumn, when they are less aqueous;",
"thus trees freeze less easily after a very hot summer, which, as gardeners say, perfectly ripens their buds, than after a cold and rainy summer, where buds do not acquire all their hardness/durability.",
"All these combined causes, either between themselves or with the particular state of each organ, or with the nature of intimate tissue of each plant, explain quite well the diversity of action of a same degree of coldness on various plants.",
"If we examine in the same way the action of a very high temperature, we will see that certain plants, such as very hard woods, resist it because, containing little aqueous juices, they offer little material to evaporate;",
"others, such as fatty plants, because they are endowed with a very small number of evaporative organs;",
"others, like the herbs of humid places, because they pump promptly a sufficient quantity of water to supply for the effects of evaporation.",
"Although it is with very complex causes that plants resist extreme actions of cold and heat, and by their combination one could perhaps explain completely why such plant freezes in a place where another very similar tree does not freeze, it would be, I think, impossible to explain by these simple considerations of physics why, between the very limits where vegetation is possible, different plants require different degrees of heat to ensure that a seed germinates at 5~6°, and that another will require 20° or 30° to sprout.",
"This diversity, which one finds in animals, must very probably be related to the intensity of excitability of fiber or tissue of each species, in both organic kingdoms.",
"The problem is complicated thus by noticeable physical causes and physiological causes that we are obliged to recognize, even if we cannot understand them with precision.",
"The influence of temperature on the geography of plants must be studied under three points of view: 1° the average temperature of the year; 2° extreme temperatures, either cold or hot; 3° the distribution of temperature in different months of the year.",
"The average temperature, which for a long time was the almost unique object of physicians, is in reality the least important data for the geography of plants:",
"to consider it only as a vague indication, it is a rather practical/convenient instrument;",
"but the same average temperature can be determined by such different circumstances, that the consequences and analogies which can be deduced from them on vegetation would be very erroneous."" ",
"One draws more limited but more exact results from the study of extreme points of temperature:",
"thus every locality which, if only from time to time, presents either coldness or hotness of a certain intensity cannot exhibit in the wild state the plants that are incapable of enduring this extreme degree.",
"When these extreme temperatures recur only in long intervals, man can keep up in that country a plant culture which does not maintain the wild state, either because, each time it is destroyed by the extreme rigor of the season, he reestablishes it by the seeds or the plants drawn from the more temperate countries, or because, in these critical moments, he shelters it against bad weathers; or, finally, because the farmer does not always demand from plants fertile seeds.",
"It is likewise that grape vine, olive tree, and most of our farmed plants grow very well for our usage in the climates where it would have been impossible to survive winters, if they were left to themselves:",
"it is one of the causes which establishes an absolute difference between agricultural geography and botanical geography.",
"In botanical geography, which essentially concerns us here, plants can establish themselves permanently in a country only when this country does not present, even from time to time, the causes of complete destruction.",
"Thus, whatever be the average temperature, a plant cannot remain wild in a climate where, even if it were every twenty years, it would become frozen;",
"or, if some seeds are brought there by accidental causes, they never have time to establish themselves in a permanent manner.",
"The annual plants, which have no other means to reproduce than their seeds, are completely excluded from every locality where any bad weather can either kill them or prevent the production of their seeds:",
"also they are exclusively limited to temperate regions.",
"The perennial plants can still remain wild in the climates which do not permit them to always produce seeds;",
"those which are endowed with particular means to reproduce by roots can live even in the climates where they almost never produce fertile seeds.",
"Under these diverse relations, and under many others, the distribution of temperature in the months of the year is the most important part of this study.",
"It is the eminently uniform climates, in which a certain average temperature is produced by a mild winter and a cool summer:",
"such are in general all the maritime countries; which is due to the fact that their temperature is continuously brought near the average by the sea, this vast reservoir of constant temperature, which cools them in summer and warms them up in winter:",
"such are also, without our understanding the reasons, the western parts of the two continents of the northern hemisphere, and, up to a certain point, almost entirety of the southern hemisphere.",
"On the contrary, a same average temperature can be produced by the combination of very cold winters and very hot summers:",
"it is what is observed in the continental countries compared to maritime countries, in the eastern parts of continents compared to the western parts, in the norther hemisphere compared to the southern hemisphere.",
"The annual plants, which absolutely need heat during summer to mature their seeds, and which can pass winter being dormant, that is to say, in a state of seeds and indifferent to coldness, prefer the climates of the second series;",
"the perennial plants, which can do better without ripening their seeds, and which dread the bitter colds of winter, prefer the first series.",
"Among them, plants which lose their leaves adapt better to uneven climates, and the evergreens prefer regular/even climates.",
"If one comes down from these general data to details, one will conceive easily how the temperature of each season in particular, how the duration of heat in certain times of the year or of the day (duration that our meteorological table represents only imperfectly,) can exclude such or such plant from each locality.",
"I can only indicate, for the lack of space, the principles and the progress of reason:",
"those who wish to study this curious topic extensively must read and meditate the beautiful work of Mr. de Humboldt on the isothermal lines, inserted in the third volume of the Mémoires de la société d’Arcueil.",
"The influence of solar light on the vegetation is almost as important as that of temperature, and, although it influences the geographic distribution of plants a bit less than the preceding factor, it nonetheless merits a distinctive mention.",
"Light is the agent which operates the greatest number of phenomena of the plant life.",
"1° It determines a great part of the absorption of sap;",
"plants pump little humidity during the night and in darkness.",
"2° It entirely determines the aqueous emanation of the green parts of plants;",
"these do not exhale, or almost do not exhale, water during the night or in darkness, while this exhalation is considerable during the day and above all in direct sunlight.",
"3° The light determines, if not absolutely in all cases, at least in almost all well known cases that interest us the most, light is determinative, I say, in parenchyma [ground tissue of nonwoody structure] of the green parts, decomposition of carbonic acid, and consequently fixation of carbon in plants, coloration of green parts, extent of their thickness and lengthening, intensity of visible/sensitive properties, and finally, direction of several organs.",
"4° It is one of the principal causes, and maybe unique cause, of singular behaviors known under the name of sleep of leaves and flowers.",
"5° During the absence of the light, green parts absorb a certain quantity of oxygen gas, determined for each of them in a given time.",
"Although these diverse influences are exercised on almost all plants, they are not exercised on all species to the same extent, and it is from this diversity that emerges the need of each plant for a particular dose of light.",
"To consider the globe in its totality, light is on average more equally distributed than heat;",
"but it offers important contrasts in its mode of distribution.",
"In the countries situated near the equator, an intense light, because it acts more perpendicularly, illuminates plants more or less equally throughout the year for twelve hours each day.",
"As one is distanced from the equator and nearer to the pole, intensity of light beams that have become more oblique diminishes;",
"but, by the distribution of these beams, light is lacking almost completely in winter, where the absence of vegetation renders it almost useless to plants, and is almost uninterrupted for the duration of vegetation, so that its continuity compensates for its intensity in total or in part.",
"Although the consequences of the continuity of light have not been sufficiently studied, one already sees, after this general data, that, independently of what is related to temperature, the plants which lose their leaves can better survive in northern countries, and that the continuously vegetating plants [plantes à végtation] must have a greater need of southern regions.",
"Plants whose leaves and flowers habitually conserve the same position can live in the northern climates, where light is almost uninterrupted in summer;",
"it is in the southern climates that one finds and should find the species which are remarkable by alternative sleep and waking of their leaves or flowers, movement which is in relation to the alternating days and nights.",
"In the countries situated at the sea level, solar beams reach plants only through a thick atmosphere, which extinguishes, so to speak, part of their radiance;",
"as one grows on the summits of mountains, action of these beams is more intense because atmosphere is less thick:",
"from which results that, under each given latitude, the species which need proportionally more light than heat must occupy the summit of the mountains, and those which need more heat than light must remain on the plains.",
"All those who have tried to cultivate the alpine plants on the plains know how difficult it is to imitate this station and to give them brightness without much heat.",
"Finally, in each determined country, plants are distributed among diverse localities, according to their need for a certain quantity of light, and according to the point at which each of them can, without much suffering, survive a certain degree of darkness.",
"Thus, all plants with very aqueous leaves, which need much evaporation; all fatty plants which, having very little evaporative organs, need a stimulant to surely influence their action; all those which are made of a tissue rich in carbon, or which have very resinous or oily juices, or which offer a great extent of green surfaces, etc., need much light and are found in the discovered places:",
"others, depending whether they are moved further from these conditions, live either in light shadow of shrubs or stronger shadow of hedges or walls, or in shades of forests (which vary among themselves depending on the nature of trees,) or, as certain mushrooms do, in caves or in total darkness.",
"Plants have been little studied, regarding the dose of light that they need;",
"but I do not doubt that there are, in this respect, great diversities, and that they can explain the diversities of stations:",
"thus, I saw ferns remain green in the caves where other plants were all atrophied;",
"like this, I saw the artificial lamp light produce very diverse effects on different plants exposed to it.",
"This topic would be worthwhile researches for some exact observers.",
"Even the periods where a certain dose of light reaches plants, although less variable than temperature, present further interest.",
"Thus, for example, mosses and shrubs that are always green, such as holly, which grow principally in winter, fare very well in the forests of trees which lose their leaves, where other plants which grow mostly in summer cannot survive.",
"Everyone knows the absolute necessity of water for vegetation, and physiologists are, in this regard, distinguished from commoners only because some, such as Van-Helmont, had the art of further exaggerating such powerful effect.",
"If we limit ourselves first to the examination of water as part of soil itself, we know that it is the universal vehicle that brings to plants all their aliments, and that it itself is part of the nourishment which settles in plants and increases their solid parts.",
"Under this double-relation, plants can differ by the absolute quantity of water that they acquire, by the mode of its absorption, and by each species’s need for finding certain materials dissolved in water that it absorbs.",
"Let us show in few words the influence of these differences on botanical geography.",
"The diverse quantity of water absorbed by each species offers the most pronounced differences, and one knows that it is one of the causes which influence most strongly on the topographical distribution of plants.",
"Those which need to absorb a great quantity of water—that is, those with weak and spongy tissue; those with large, soft leaves especially with a great number of cortical pores; those which carry only little or no hair on their surface; those with rapid growth; those which form little oily or resinous materials; those whose parts are not easily altered or corrupted by humidity; those, finally, whose roots are very numerous—generally need to absorb lots of water and can survive only in the places where they naturally find a great proportion of water.",
"Those, on the contrary, with compressed and compact tissue, with small, hard leaves with little number of pores; those with lots of fairs; those with slow growth; those which form in the course of their vegetation lots of oily or resinous materials; those whose tissue can be easily altered or corrupted by too much humidity; those, finally, whose roots are not numerous need little quantity of water and prefer for their natural station the driest places.",
"The degrees of action of each of causes that I have just enumerated, and their mutual combination, determine for each species the need for a quantity of water.",
"But, however complicated these causes may be, they must be combined with others:",
"thus, the higher the temperature, and more intense the light is in a given time and place, all things being equal, the more plants need to absorb a greater quantity of water because they combine and eliminate it more.",
"Hence the need for certain plants to find more or less water at certain points of their life, or in certain localities, or in certain modes of culture.",
"If I follow in detail this progress of reasoning, I can show clearly how plants, by diverse causes, need a determined quantity of water, and consequently, must thrive each in the locality which responds to these needs.",
"But the examples are too easy to find that it is worthwhile to present them to the reader.",
"The very consequences of the general laws which I have indicated are generally known:",
"thus, one knows that the plants with deep roots prosper better in the countries that are subject to long dry periods because the bottom of the vegetable land always contains a bit of humidity;",
"those with superficial roots can live only in the climates where humidity is kept more, etc.",
"But the nature of the water that plants absorb further presents great diversities:",
"the less the water is loaded with nutritive principles, the more it is necessary that plants absorb it in a given time to suffice their food;",
"on the contrary, the more the water is loaded with principles which alter its fluidity or transparency, and which, as solid molecules, tend to obstruct the orifice of pores or disturb absorption by their viscosity, the less the plants absorb it in a given time.",
"The very nature of the molecules dissolved or suspended in water much influences the topographic distribution of plants.",
"These dissolved materials are: 1° carbonic acid; 2° atmospheric air; 3° soluble materials, vegetable or animal; 4° alkaline or earthy/muddy principles.",
"One easily understands that, although the special needs of plants are much less different from those of animals compared among themselves, there must be in this regard remarkable diversities.",
"Although this object was less studied than other parts of the plant physiology, one can already catch a good glimpse of the facts which are related to it:",
"thus, the plants whose tissue must contain lots of carbon, such as the trees with hardwood, fear more than others the extremely pure waters that contain little carbonic acid gas.",
"The plants which exhibit lots of nitrogen materials in their chemical composition, such as the brassicaceaes and mushrooms, prefer the terrains which contain lots of animal materials in solution;",
"the plants which exhibit in their chemical analysis a notable quantity of certain earthy substances—such as silica in the monocotyledons, the gyps of the leguminous plants, etc.—need to find them in the soil where they grow, and, if animal materials are lacking, the farmer makes sure to add them to the soil artificially.",
"The species which produce, when they are burned, more quantity of alkaline substances than usual can live only where these materials are accumulated:",
"thus, all those which have an absolute need of sodium carbonate can prosper only near the sea or saline sources;",
"some can compensate for this instinctive need by absorbing potassium carbonate, and so they can live indifferently near and far from the sea.",
"Thus, the diverse nature of materials dissolved in waters is evidently one of numerous causes which determine the stations of plant species.",
"Until now I have examined water only as it is destined to be absorbed by plants;",
"but water also acts in another relation:",
"when it is amassed in more quantity than a plant can absorb it, it reacts on its tissue, and leads to its decomposition by dissolving or corrupting it.",
"Among the plants which need to absorb a great quantity of water, there are those which cannot stand for a long time against this external action of the accumulated water:",
"thus, the plants with very starchy roots, such as succulent bulbs or the bulbous roots of protea argentea, or the starchy tubers of cyclamens, are rather easily influenced by humidity, and consequently these plants cannot live in aquatic or marshy places.",
"On the contrary, stems and leaves of certain plants are naturally endowed with the means by which they can fight against the actions of external water.",
"Thus, some have the faculty of secreting a viscous material which envelops them and protects them against the water;",
"it is what can be easily observed in batrachospermum, for example:",
"others, such as many potamogetons, ooze to their surface a kind of glazing which prevents water from touching them, and which serves to defend them from water, precisely as the oil that coats the feathers of aquatic birds.",
"Finally, monocotyledon plants, whose surface has a remarkably siliceous tissue which is consequently very little influenced by humidity, resist better than the dicotyledons the external action of water.",
"Also we see a greater number of aquatic plants among the monocotyledons than among the dicotyledons;",
"also, certain plants, even starches, such as aloes, can live several months under water without being noticeably altered by water.",
"May I be permitted to remark in passing here, that it is to the cause of this quantity of silica and this unchangeability which is its result, that most of the people have chosen the monocotyledons to cover their houses?",
"The northern people have used straws according to the same principle by which the tropical peoples use the leaves of palm trees.",
"What I have just said of the accumulated water in the liquid state around the roots or leaves of plants would be applicable, with mild modifications, to the water dissolved or suspended in the air:",
"it is what we will see later, in speaking of the influence of the atmosphere;",
"but I must first say some words on the influence of the soil.",
"This influence is perhaps still more complicated than all the preceding ones;",
"one can however reduce it to three principal considerations.",
"1° The soil serves as the point of bearing for plants, and consequently its consistency must give it, under this relation, a particular aptitude for supporting plants endowed with diverse forms.",
"Thus, the terrains of very mobile sand can support only the plants that are either short and crouched so that the wind would not knock them over, or the trees with deep, branched roots to fix them in the mobile matrix;",
"these two effects would further be modified in their results depending on whether the country is subject to impulsive winds, whether the trees live naturally in isolation or grow in numerous societies protecting each other reciprocally.",
"The inverse laws are found to be true for dense terrains:",
"the plants with small roots can be sufficiently fixed there, and these alone can live there;",
"for the roots that are too big cannot penetrate into excessively rough terrains.",
"Finally, the two extreme terms of this series equally present the sterile terrains:",
"overly mobile sands, or strong currents of water; overly dense clays, or very hard rocks are, by inverse causes, almost entirely deprived of vegetation.",
"2° The chemical nature of the earth or rocks which compose the terrain also influences the choice of plants which can populate it or prosper there;",
"but it is here still an effect which, although in simple appearance, is in reality very complex.",
"The different grounds influence vegetation through physical circumstances, thus, for example, whether they are more or less endowed with hygroscopic force, or in other terms, whether they absorb surrounding water more or less easily, whether they retain it with more or less force, or abandon it more or less easily.",
"The plants which require more or less humidity can prosper in such or such ground;",
"but this effect, evident in itself, is complicated with other circumstances:",
"thus, Kirwan showed by the comparative analysis of soils known to be good for wheat in diverse countries, that they contain all the more silica as the climate is more subject to rain, all the more aluminum as the climate is less rainy;",
"or, in other terms, that the terrain, to be good for a given plant, must be more hygroscopic in a dry climate, less hygroscopic in a humid climate:",
"from which results evidently that, in different localities, one can find the same species of plants in different terrains.",
"3° Each rock has a certain degree of tenacity and a certain disposition to break down or become pulverized:",
"from this results more or less great ease for certain terrains to be formed either of sand or of gravel, and to be composed of fragments that are of more or less determined form or size.",
"Certain plants, by the causes indicated above, can prefer such or such of these sands or of these gravels;",
"but the unique nature of the rock acts here only indirectly:",
"thus, when one encounters limestone rocks which break down like clay schists, one finds there the same species of plants.",
"The two considerations that I have just noted are particularly applicable to the lichens of rocks.",
"4° The rocks, according to their color or their nature, are more susceptible to be heated by direct sunlight, and consequently, they can modify a little the temperature of a given place;",
"consequently, also, they can influence, even if mildly, the choices of plants that are susceptible to prosper there.",
"But, independent of all these physical causes, does the chemical nature of rocks have influence on plants?",
"One cannot, without doubt, deny it absolutely;",
"but one must agree that this action was in general much exaggerated.",
"It must be noted, in fact, that plants do not generally live on pure rocks, but in a detritus of these very rocks;",
"that even the rocks of a rather marked-out country often exhibit very diverse natures;",
"that the vegetal ground is not only formed by rocks which immediately surround it, but further by the mixture of earthy molecules transported by water and wind and deposited in a given place by the debris of animals or plants which have been inhabiting there.",
"It results from all these causes that vegetal grounds differ much less among themselves than do the rocks which give them support, and that most of plants find the earthy aliments which are necessary for them in most of terrains;",
"also, after seven years of travels in France, I have ended up finding almost all plants emerging spontaneously in almost all mineralogical terrains.",
"When it is a matter of a little extended locality, and consequently, of a same/constant climate, one finds sometimes certain plants which live only within the limit of a terrain;",
"but, when one expands one’s researches on a more extended space, one often sees this same plant living, under a different climate, in the terrain it disdains elsewhere.",
"I could cite a crowd of examples in support of these diverse assertions:",
"thus one says that the box tree grows only in the terrain of lime stones, and it is true that it seems to prefer these terrains;",
"but I found it in abundance in the schists of clay-gravel mixture in the Pyrenees, and it is not completely excluded from the granites of England nor from the volcanic terrains of Auvergne.",
"One says that the sweet chestnut tree never grows in chalky/lime stony countries, and it is in fact most rare there than elsewhere;",
"however one finds beautiful chestnut trees from the two sides of the lake of Geneva, at the bottom of chalky/lime stony mountains of the Jura and Chablais.",
"Mr. Carradori found, by the laboratory experiences, that pure magnesium oxide is a poison for most of plants;",
"and Mr. Dunal, having visited, at my request, a place in the environs of Lunel, where the soil exhibits a great quantity of almost pure magnesium oxide, found there the same plants as in the chalky/lime stone environment, and their roots prospering in the cracks of this magnesium rock.",
"Thus, without rejecting entirely the influence of the chemical nature of the grounds (and above, when speaking of the materials dissolved in water, I have cited some examples which prove it,) I think that it should never be separated from the purely physical influences, and that one has generally attributed to it an exaggerated importance.",
"The more we advance into the career that we have proposed, the more we find that everything is complicated, that no effect can be produced by a unique cause, that no agent operates in a simple manner.",
"Thus, the atmosphere can act either simultaneously or separately by its accidental composition, that is to say, by water and other materials it contains, suspended or dissolved; by its movement, by its transparency and density.",
"I do not speak of its primitive composition, for the most exact experiences have proven that the proportions of nitrogen and oxygen are constantly the same in the atmosphere;",
"but the materials which do not form the integrant and necessary part of the atmosphere become mixed in certain places, and renders more or less appropriate atmosphere for certain species of plants.",
"Thus, as this has taken place in certain caves or mines, the quantities of carbonic acid gas or of hydrogen can be rather considerable for preventing the vegetation of all plants, or for permitting only the vegetation of some, either more robust or more avid of these substances.",
"Thus, the air charged with saline emanations of the sea harms certain plants, and favors on the contrary the development of those which need soda carbonate, as one sees in the valleys of southern Europe, where marine plants are found, as long as they are [ouvertes de son côté] and exposed to marine wind.",
"But these diverse effects are limited to the localities that are little extended;",
"the most general influence that atmosphere exercises regarding the substances it contains is its hygroscopic influence.",
"It is usually charged with water, either invisible and simply noticeable by hygrometer, or visible and in the state of vapor.",
"One has only a small number of precise observations or experiences to know, 1° whether these two states of atmospheric water influence plants in different manners; 2° to determine the influence on plants in a certain usual or momentary quantity, constant or variable, of atmospheric humidity.",
"The experiences of farmers, although a bit vague, and the observations deduced from the distribution of plants on the earth prove that this influence is rather important:",
"such a plant prospers better, at equal temperature, in a moderately humid air; another in a very humid air or very dry air.",
"It is one of the circumstances that outdoor cultivation cannot imitate, that greenhouse cultivation imitates only imperfectly, and which causes, consequently, the difficulties that we experience in transporting plants from a country to another.",
"Consequently, it[atmosphere] must also influence the geography of plants, and merits more attention than travelers have accorded to it until now.",
"It is partly on this cause that depends the difference between the vegetation of maritime countries and that of continental countries, between mountains and planes, etc.",
"Fogs prevent fecundation of flowers, and consequently, such plant cannot usually prosper in a climate which is too often cloudy at the time of its flowering.",
"The influence of the agitation of the air is well known in extreme cases, but still has not been appreciated in detail.",
"Everyone knows that the winds that are too impetuous break or uproot the trees, and their effect is serious in the countries where these accidents are intense or frequent;",
"it is so especially when the nature of the soil is more sandy, and when it concerns trees with higher/steeper stems, more ramified branches, more fragile wood, larger leaves, bigger fruits.",
"But the absolute stagnation of the air also seems harmful to vegetation:",
"already many gardeners have observed that it is well to establish a bit of movement in the greenhouse air;",
"and recently Mr. Knight proved that the trees that are kept immobile grow less in a given time than those which are subject to the action of wind.",
"Although this effect has not been appreciated enough to know if it influences the distribution of plants, I do not believe I should pass it entirely in silence.",
"However, of all influences of the atmosphere, perhaps the most difficult to reduce to its true value is the action of its density, or, which is the same thing as the influence of the absolute height on vegetation.",
"I have already sought to analyze this influence of the height in a memoir which forms part of the third volume of the Société d’Arcueil, and I will limit myself to indicate the general bases of the phenomenon.",
"Height can influence plants because it has a very pronounced action on temperature, intensity of the solar light, surrounding humidity, and rarity of atmospheric air.",
"As one is elevated in the atmosphere, the temperature diminishes, according to the laws that are well known today to physicians, and which seem to depend upon that the rare air has more capacity for heat than the dense air.",
"The facts which prove that the lowering of temperature in high mountains is one of the causes which influence the most the distribution of plants are the following.",
"1° The fixity of the natural growth of each plant to a determined elevation above the sea level is especially greater when it concerns the countries that are nearest to the equator, especially lesser when it concerns more temperate countries:",
"which has to do with the fact that, the further one is removed from the equator, the more exposure of a given place has influence on its temperature.",
"2° In temperate countries, such as France, for example, the plants which are little affected by temperature and which grow at all latitudes, grow also at all heights where the terrain is not covered by eternal snow, from the sea level up to the summit of mountains.",
"I have collected around seven hundred examples of this law:",
"thus, common heather, juniper, birch, etc. grow indifferently of the sea level and to 3,000 meters of height.",
"3° If the plants which, according to their constitution, fear overly hot or cold temperature grow at diverse latitudes, one observes that it is at such heights that the effect of elevation can counterbalance that of latitude:",
"thus, the plants of the northern plains grow in Midi on the mountains.",
"4° The plants cultivated on a grand scale follow the laws that exactly correspond to the precedents:",
"those that are cultivated at all latitudes vegetate also at all heights;",
"those that are found only at specific latitudes also do not grow at proportional heights:",
"potato, which is so common in our plains, grows in Chile up to 3,600 meters of elevation;",
"olive tree, which is found nowhere at 44° of latitude, does not grow above 400 meters of height.",
"5° The elevation above the sea level establishes, in the comparison of seasonal temperatures, the effects analogous to those which result from the distance from the equator, so that the effects on vegetation are all the more analogous in the two cases.",
"As one is lifted in a vertical line, it results from the decreased density of the air that the intensity of solar light will be augmented:",
"this effect is represented in the line of distances to the equator, since the continuity of light for the duration of vegetation is all the greater at a more elevated latitude.",
"As one is lifted in the mountains, one sees hygrometer, by its descending progress, indicate that humidity of the air is diminishing:",
"the same general effect takes place as one moves from the equator to the pole.",
"In the mountains that are covered with eternal snow and where plants are habitually watered with ice water, the plants which fear overly high temperature can live at lower heights than at the heights where, under the same latitude, they can survive when they are not watered by the snow water.",
"It seems thus that, under all these relations, the variety of fixity of plants to certain heights has eminently to do with the lowering of temperature according to elevation.",
"The only point of view, purely theoretical, according to which one could believe that the rarity of the air itself has a direct action on vegetation—it is the need that plants have of absorbing a greater or less quantify of oxygen gas during the night through their green parts, and day and night by their colored parts.",
"It is without doubt that there is a limit of elevation where the atmosphere, which has become too rare, would not present enough air to satisfy this need of plants;",
"but everywhere mountains end up being covered with snow before this effect becomes perceptible.",
"Also, let us look at the plants which need greater dose of oxygen, just like those which need the least, growing indifferently in plains and in mountains.",
"If this influence thus counts for something in the station of plants at certain heights, it does not seem to me significant compared to the predominant influence of the temperature of light and humidity.",
"The decrease of the air pressure can further, according to Mr. Humboldt, favor and increase evaporation.",
"This effect is certain in theory;",
"but I do not know the means, given the current knowledge, to appreciate its real influence.",
"To prove how much, in temperate climates, the influence of height is weaker than one could believe, I have listed in a following table which forms part of the memoir mentioned earlier, the maxima and minima of heights where I found a same species of plants.",
"These tables, where I have almost always purposefully neglected the examples where the difference does not reach a thousand meters, prove that the influence of heights is much less than one has believed.",
"We have just analyzed the general influence of the external agents on plants, and caught glimpse how each plant’s unique structure, combined with this general influence, determines for each species the possibility of surviving in a certain place or its greater prosperity in a certain locality.",
"We must now apply these general data to stations and habitations of plants.",
"It is on this fundamental distinction that, it seems to me, rest all means of applying precision in the generalization of known facts.",
"The term station indicates the special nature of the locality in which each species is accustomed to grow, and the term habitation is a general indication of the country where it grows naturally.",
"The term station is essentially relative to climate, terrain of a given place;",
"the term habitation is more relative to geographic and even geological circumstances.",
"The station of Salicornia is in saline marshes, that of the aquatic buttercups is in gentle and stagnant waters;",
"the habitation of these two plants is in Europe, that of tulip trees in northern America.",
"The study of stations is, that is to say, topography, and the study of habitations is botanical geography.",
"Confusion of these two classes of ideas is one of the causes which have retarded science the most, and which have prevented it from acquiring exactitude.",
"We see very clearly that, in a bound/given region, plants are distributed uniquely by the need that each of them has, according to its structure, of certain combinations of the environments where it must live.",
"Does the same cause determine the habitations?",
"It is one of the fundamental questions of science, and even for the discussion of facts, it is important to not confuse those which are relative to these two classes of ideas.",
"We will first limit ourselves to the examination of stations of plants of a same region.",
"The laws relative to stations appear to be applicable in all regions;",
"but one should compare only the examples that are truly comparable, that is, taken from a same region.",
"All plants of a country, all those of a given place, are in a state of war relative to each other.",
"All are given more or less efficient means of reproduction and nutrition.",
"The first which were settled by chance in a given locality tend to, by the mere fact that they occupy the ground, exclude other species from it:",
"the biggest ones stifle the smallest ones;",
"the more perennial ones replace those with shorter duration;",
"the most fertile ones gradually take over the space that could have been occupied by others which do not multiply as well.",
"In this perpetual war, two principal phenomena take place.",
"1° Certain plants, according to their organization, need certain conditions of existence:",
"one cannot survive where it has no access to such quantity of water or such intensity of solar light at certain time of the year, etc.",
"It results from this need of certain circumstances, that certain plants cannot grow in certain localities: first cause of the local distribution of plants.",
"2° The conditions of existence of each species are not rigorously fixed, but admit a certain latitude between limits.",
"One can, for each species, determine the point which agrees the best with its nature, relatively to the dose of heat, light, humidity, etc. that it must receive to be in maximum prosperity possible:",
"once this point is determined, one should recognize soon that each species can deviate from it more or less, within any limits.",
"When these limits are close to each other, the plant is more delicate;",
"it can survive only in a small number of localities, and for the same reason, can neither be naturalized in the distance nor be cultivated easily:",
"such are, for example, heathers, pinguicula, brunia, etc.",
"When these limits are large and the larger they are, the more robust is the plant;",
"the more it can live in diverse localities;",
"also the easier it can be cultivated and naturalized in the distance:",
"such are most of the grasses, plantains, centaureas, etc.",
"One finds all degrees of delicateness or strength between these two extremes.",
"But, as the locality in which a plant grows is more contrary to its nature, it also grows there more weakly;",
"which means that such species, carex arenaria, I suppose, which, in a sandy terrain acquires all its growth and stifles all its neighbors, can be in a dense terrain stifled in its turn by these very species that it would have taken control over in its preferred ground.",
"What the terrain produces in the example I have cited can be produced by the temperature, light, water, or atmosphere in other easily noticeable cases;",
"moreover, the same plants, in the same localities, fight each other, and with different successes depending on their age.",
"Thus, in the sand dunes cultivation, one sows broom and pine haphazardly:",
"broom, which grows very rapidly, dominates and protects young pines, and when it feels too squashed/packed, it sometimes stifles them;",
"pine, when it escapes from this danger, grows more than brooms, becomes bigger than them, and stifles them in its turn.",
"The same effect can be produced by maladies or accidents, by diverse nature of layers of the earth at different depths, by bad weathers more dangerous for one species than for another, and finally, by the human action.",
"One can conclude from these facts—facts that I am content to indicate, given that the majority are very well known—that, in each locality, among the plants which are sown there naturally and which can really survive there, those which prosper there better tend to seize space and exclude from it those which exist there in languishing: second cause of the local distribution of plants, and of the natural tendency of each plant to live in the terrain which suits it the best.",
"One can easily deduce, from these general considerations, the explanation of a fact observed for a long time, but more methodically by Mr. Humboldt, that is to say, that there are species whose individuals can be frequently found scattered here and there, and others, which are named social plants, whose individuals are found in groups as in numerous societies.",
"Thus, to cite the extremes of these two manners of living, cypripedium calceolus or orchis hircina lives almost always isolated, while heathers of the West, rhododendrons of the Alps, potamogetons, etc. live most frequently in numerous societies.",
"This effect is due to diverse causes.",
"Thus, when a given terrain is of such a particular nature that it suits very well for certain species and badly for most of others, those which prosper there end up seizing the entire space.",
"It is how one finds social plants in all specific terrains:",
"such are the elimus arenarius in sands, sphagnum in peaty places, rhododendrons on the elevated slopes of the Alps, heathers in moors, etc.",
"All these plants are social, since they live only in the specific localities.",
"On the contrary, when a terrain agrees, to the same degrees, with a great number of different plants, these fight together in equal forces to become established there, and thus live there mixed together.",
"It is how all the bad herbs prospering haphazardly in our farmed terrains when they are left to their liberty;",
"it is how the forests of fertile tropical regions present a mixture of several trees, while those of temperate countries, less favored by climate, normally present a dominant variety.",
"Finally, the eminently robust species, which by this fact are the most often dispersed, become social sometimes:",
"it is what has taken place, for example, in very bad terrains, where these robust plants can survive, while all others perish;",
"it is how the individuals of eryngium campestre are permeated in certain countries, and often live in societies in semi-fixed sands at the border of seas.",
"To these general causes, deduced from the mode of nutrition, one must add the causes which depend on the reproduction of plants:",
"those which propagate by roots, stems, or jets rampans, like the pilosella; those which produce a great number of seeds, and whose seeds cannot be easily transported by winds to distances, live closer to each other, than those with analogous organization but with less numerous and very volatile seeds.",
"The disposition or the relationship of individuals of a same species is thus an immediate consequence of the general theory of stations, such as we have developed above.",
"The classification of the stations of plants, which, in the style that it is exposed in most of books, seems too simple, is in reality too complicated and little susceptible to rigorous exactitude.",
"We have seen, in the first part of this article, how a single factor of the circumstances which influence vegetation presents modifications, most of them simultaneous;",
"now, a station is a type of average result produced by various and unequal combination of all these circumstances:",
"thus, marshes vary among themselves, depending whether they are supplied with mild water or with salt water, whether they are on a clay ground or on sand, in plains or on mountain, in a hot climate or cold climate, etc.",
"Although this difficulty is evident, there exists the general data of the stations, such that it is useful to distinguish them, even if it cannot be done rigorously.",
"Here are the classes which seem the least uncertain, that is:",
"1° The maritime or saline plants, that is to say, those which, without growing underneath salt water and without floating on its surface, however need to live near the salt water to absorb a portion of it, necessary for their nourishment.",
"One must distinguish here those which, like glasswort, live in the salty marshes, and which seem to absorb the saline materials by their roots and leaves; those which, similar to roccella fuciformis, live on the rocks exposed to marine air, and seem to absorb only by their leaves; and, finally, the plants, such as eryngium campestre, which do not need saline water, but which live on the border of the sea as elsewhere because they are rather robust and do not fear the action of salts.",
"2° The marine plants, recently called thalassiophyles by Mr. Lamouroux, which grow either plunged into the saline water or floating on the surface.",
"These plants are distributed in the depth of the sea or saline waters, according to the degrees of salt concentration of the water; according to the usual degrees of its agitation, continuity, or intermittence of their immersion, the degrees of persistence of the ground, and perhaps the intensity of the light.",
"3° The aquatic plants, which live plunged into the gentle waters, either entirely immersed like conferves, or floating on the surface like stratiotes; or fixed in the ground by their roots, with leaves in the water, like many potamogetons; or rooted in the ground and growing or floating on the surface like the numphoea, or growing above the surface like alismaplantago.",
"This latter sub-division is much closely related to the following class.",
"4° The plants of the marshes of stagnant water and of very humid places, among which one must distinguish principally those of peaty terrains, marsh plains, from the edge of running waters; and, finally, those of the terrains inundated in winter and more or less dried out in summer.",
"5° The plants of the plains and pasturelands, in the study of which one must distinguish those which, by their social union, either natural or artificial, form the base of the plains, and those which grow among themselves with more or less frequency and facility.",
"These plants of plains differ only by the degrees of humidity from those of the marshy plains.",
"6° The plants of the farming/cultivated terrains.",
"This class is absolutely due to human action:",
"the plants which grow in our farming lands are those which, in the wild state, delight in the mild and substantial/solid terrains;",
"many of them were transported from a country to another with the very seeds of the cultivated plants.",
"Those which are found in the fields, vineyards, and gardens, although often the same, often also present a particular selection by the mode of cultivation.",
"7° The plants from rock fields, from which one passes, by imperceptible nuances, to the plants of walls, of stony and rocky places, and to the plants of gravels, which, as the mass of fragments diminishes, lead us by numerous nuances to the following class.",
"The study of plants of rocks presents remarkable diversities, according to the unique nature of each rock.",
"8° The plants of sands or of very loose terrains, for the classification of which one feels some difficulty:",
"for the plants of coastal sands are confused with saline plants; those of loose terrains with the species of farmed terrains; and those of coarse sands do not differ from those of gravels.",
"9° The plants of barren places [wastelands], by reason that they are very dense, just as the clay terrains are, or those whose surface area hardens by dryness or heat, or those which are packed by humans or animals.",
"This heterogeneous class contains plants that are not distinct.",
"10° The plants of rubbles, or which emerge next to human habitations:",
"these species, in small number, seem to be determined in the choice of their station, some by their need for nitrous salts, others perhaps by their need for nitrogenous materials.",
"11° The plants of the forests, among which one must distinguish the trees which, by their union, compose the forest, and the plants which can with more or less facility grow under their shelter.",
"Among the vegetable inhabitants of woods, their distribution in forests of diverse essences are determined according to the greater or lesser degrees of obscurity that each species can support, either all year long as in the forests of green trees, or during the entire summer, in the forests of trees which lose their leaves.",
"12° The plants of bushes and hedges.",
"The shrubs which compose this station differ from the forest plants by their lower dimensions and by lightness of their shade:",
"the species which grow among themselves are more particularly the climbing herbs.",
"13° The underground plants, which live either in more or less obscure caves, like byssus, or in the very heart of the ground, like truffles.",
"These plants can do without the action of the light, and many of them cannot even bear it.",
"The species which emerge from the cavities of old trunks have a close relation with those from caves.",
"14° The plants of mountains, among which one could include as sub-division all other stations.",
"One is used to classify as mountain plants those which, in our climates, can be found only an absolute height of more than 500 meters;",
"but this limit is absolutely arbitrary.",
"The most important division to establish among the mountain plants is that of the species which grow in the alpine mountains where the snow persists throughout summer, and where watering is not only continuous but all the more abundant and colder than it is hot; and of the species which grow in the mountains stripped of snow during summer, and where, consequently, watering ceases at the moment when it is most necessary.",
"These latter are evidently more robust than the former, and are much easier to subject to cultivation.",
"15° The parasitic plants, that is, which are stripped of the faculty, either of pumping their food from the sun or of completely developing their food, and which can live only by absorbing sap from another plant:",
"one finds them in all preceding stations.",
"One must distinguish among the parasitic plants: 1) those which emerge to the surface of plants, and establish themselves there to live off of the plants, such as mistletoe and dodder; and 2) the intestinal parasites, which develop in the very interior of the living plants, and most often pierce the epidermis to come outside, such as uredo and aecidium.",
"16° The faux-parasitic plants, that is, which live on either dead or living plants, but without pumping sap from them.",
"This class, which was often confused with the preceding class, presents three rather distinct sub-divisions.",
"The first, which is related to the true parasites, includes cryptogamic plants, whose germs, probably brought during the act of vegetation, develop at the time when either the plant or the organ which contains it starts to decay, and which live from its substance during its suffering or after its death;",
"such are nemaspores and spheries:",
"these are intestinal faux-parasites.",
"The second includes either cryptogamic plants like lichens and mosses, or phanerogamic plants [seed plants] like epidendrums, which live on the living trees without pumping their sap, and by nourishing themselves either with superficial humidity of the bark or with that of the air:",
"these are superficial faux-parasites;",
"many can live on rocks, dead trees, or soil.",
"The third includes accidental faux-parasites, like the herbs that emerge here and there in the cavities of trunks.",
"These sixteen classes encompass rather tolerably the totality of the known plants;",
"but, as I have warned, they should not be considered in a rigorous manner.",
"Some are related to the influence of the soil, others to that of the water, others to that of the air or the light;",
"and in each of them one has taken a predominant element as the basis of division, and one has momentarily neglected all the others.",
"This method is little logical;",
"but one is forced to be content with it where the very numerous causes become complicated together.",
"The influence of the temperature, although very powerful on plants, has been neglected in the classification of stations;",
"we see it, on the contrary, holding the first rank in the little that is noticeable for us in the theory of habitations, which we will consider now.",
"If the study of stations presented to us already the vague parts that are little subject to rigorous assessments, that of habitations offers us this incertitude of even greater degrees.",
"A part of the phenomenon of the distribution of plants in diverse countries seems to have a lot to do with the noticeable influence of the temperature;",
"but it is still a part of facts which escapes all current theories, since it is connected to the very origin of organized beings, that is to say, to the most obscure subject of natural philosophy.",
"All or almost all plants, left to themselves, tend to occupy a specific space on the earth;",
"what constitutes the study of habitations is determining the laws according to which this plant division is made.",
"If one is content with knowledges relative to species, one can rather well determine, for each species, the limits by latitude, longitude, and height, which it does not tend to cross.",
"The collection of these facts of detail is the basis of this science.",
"When one will unite all the facts with precision, perhaps one will be able to deduce from it the general and thorough laws;",
"but we probably do not know half the species on the earth, and among those which we know, it is hardly half of them whose habitation is determined with precision.",
"The generalities that we try to establish at this moment are, thus, evidently provisory;",
"but they tend to, be they imperfect, make known the whole of vegetation, and direct voyagers in the selection of their later observations:",
"it is under this double-relation that they already hold a real interest.",
"The influence of the temperature is manifest when one compares the nature, number, and selection of plants which grow in the diverse countries, at different latitudes and at different heights.",
"This influence appears still greater when one considers that these elements balance each other in a manner to procure for individuals of a same species a more or less similar temperature in diverse localities where it is found.",
"Here the same phenomenon takes place as for stations;",
"that is, delicate species which need a well-determined temperature (either for intensity or for time/period) live only in a single country, while more robust species which accommodate themselves for diverse degrees of cold and heat can be found at considerable distances.",
"The temperature of the waters showing the least diversities compared to those of the air, it is probable that the aquatic plants must be, less than all others, limited to a determined climate:",
"it is also what botanists believe to have observed;",
"but I am not entirely certain that this probable result is founded on sufficiently numerous and exact comparisons.",
"The number of diverse species of a given space will increase as one advances towards hot countries, and decrease towards cold countries.",
"This law is evident in the mountains, which have far fewer plants at their summit than at their base;",
"but many other causes compete with temperature to produce this result, which is clearer when comparing the countries subject to diverse latitudes.",
"Thus, Mr. Humboldt counts 4,000 species only in the temperate America and 13,000 in the equinoctial America between the tropics, 1,500 in the temperate Asia and 4,500 in the equinoctial Asia.",
"These numbers can be only very approximate, given that different countries are very unequally known.",
"One can attain with greater precision, in comparison, under other relations, the selection of plants of north and south.",
"In general, if one starts from temperate regions, one clearly sees, 1° That the number proportional of dicotyledonous plants will increase as one approaches the equator, and diminish towards the pole;",
"2° That the number of acotyledonous or cellular plants follows an inverse law, that is, it increases towards the pole, and diminishes towards the equator;",
"3° That the number of monocotyledons, among which I include ferns, experiences little variations compared to the two preceding classes, and forms about a sixth of the total flora of each country, as it does of the entire world.",
"These three propositions can be deduced from the following table.",
"This kind of calculations cannot be exact, 1° because one compares the flora calculated according to the diverse principles and with unequal cares;",
"2° because acotyledons are much less known than the other two classes, and are even completely missing in many flora.",
"Under this last relation, one reaches a greater precision by comparing only the numerical relations of dicotyledons and of monocotyledons.",
"It is in this aim that the two following tables are directed.",
"It results from the preceding tables that, 1° If one limits oneself to continents or to great islands very near the continents, the number of monocotyledons, compared to dicotyledons, will increase towards the pole and diminish towards the equator, with much regularity.",
"2° In the islands that are distant from the continents, the proportional number of dicotyledons is smaller than their latitude seems to comprise it.",
"Thus, in Jamaica, where according to the analogy the proportion should have been 1:4, it is found to be 1:1.94;",
"in Saint Helena, where the proportion should also have been close to 1:4, it is found to be 1:1.03;",
"in Tristan da Cunha, where the proportion should have been 1:3.6, it is found to be 1:0.49.",
"This double-result, and above all the latter, could be due partly to that monocotyledons generally need more humidity than the dicotyledons:",
"also let us see that very dry regions, like the Canaries, Crimea, the Kingdom of Naples, present fewer monocotyledons than the analogous latitude indicates, while Guiana, the vicinity of Venice, which are very humid, have a bit more monocotyledons than the average of the countries situated on the same latitudes.",
"The analogous calculations, which would be too long to report them in detail, show that the number of trees, which, in proportion to herbs, is very smaller near the pole, and increases continuously as one approaches the equator, and as the greatest number of trees belong to the class of dicotyledons, this result absolutely conforms to the precedents.",
"To give an idea of this disproportion, I will say that one counts in Laplace 11 trees and 24 bushes which grow higher than two feet;",
"one finds in France 74 species of wild trees and 195 bushes growing up higher than two feet.",
"The flora of Guiani, a not so well-known country, but situated in the tropics, offers 225 trees and a very large number of shrubs, that is to say, that the proportion of trees to the totality of vegetation is, in Laplace, 1/100; in France, 1/80; in Guiani, 1/5.",
"This greater number of wooden plants observed in hot countries is confirmed again also when comparing the distribution of species of each family on the earth.",
"Thus, tree ferns live only in the tropics:",
"palm trees, which one can consider as the lily family of trees, hardly live outside of this zone:",
"mallows furnish, in the tropics, the most trees of the world, and present only grasses in more northern countries;",
"one can say the same for rubiaceaes, marigolds, etc.",
"Up to this point, we have seen the plants of the temperate zone maintain the middle between that of the glacial zone and that of the torrid zone;",
"but there is a point of view under which it has its unique character, that it is the country of preference for annual and biannual grasses.",
"Thus, in neglecting the acotyledons, Laplace presents only 36 species of grasses, which bear fruits only a single time;",
"there are only 73 of them in Guiani, and 1073 in France:",
"so that in comparing these absolute numbers with the totality of plants in each country, one finds that the proportional number of annual plants is in Laplace 1/30, in Guiani 1/17, in France beyond 1/6.",
"The extreme temperatures produce here the analogous effects:",
"the delicate grasses can succeed only in these fortunate, temperate zones where man, who in many respects is one of the most delicate beings of nature, has eminently prospered himself;",
"it is only in these fortunate climates that the bud is recreated each spring by this new greenery whose freshness is unknown to the inhabitants of the polar zone and to those who live under the sizzling sun of the equator.",
"What we have just outlined for the classes should be done for all families one day;",
"but most of foreign flora are still too incomplete for one to assign a great importance to the results that one would obtain today from long and painstaking researches done on imperfect documents.",
"Mr. de Humboldt attempted this wonderful work for some great families, and himself recorded the curious results he reached, in an article that he wished to communicate with me and which will be found at the end of this essay:",
"those who will desire to pursue this kind of researches as much as the current state of science permits should also study with care the Prolegomena of the great botanical work of Mr. de Humboldt and the notes on botanical geography which he placed at the end of the principal families of plants, and the memoirs of Mr. Brown on New Holland[Austria] and Congo, which I already cited above.",
"There is not enough space to give here all the facts of detail;",
"I endeavor above all to make known the progress of reasoning which seems to me particular to the science which some botanist-philosophes have worked to create.",
"All the laws which, in accordance with the precision of documents, we have just established on the distribution of plants with more or less probability, relative to the degrees of latitude, one must search them relative to the absolute heights above the sea;",
"but the number of plants whose habitation was considered under this relation is too limited to dare to undertake it:",
"one can already however discern that the same laws are represented/applicable here with enough precision.",
"The classes, families, or genera which approach near the pole tend to grow higher on the mountains, while those which remain in the zones near the equator are also those which in temperate countries remain on the prairies.",
"As one approaches the equator, one finds on mountains a selection of plants that are analogous, for genera and for families, to those of temperate countries;",
"and as the mountains of equinoctial countries are higher than ours, one finds there the plants of the genera and families that are analogous to our mountainous plants.",
"But, although latitude and height are the dominant causes of the average temperature of a place, there are still other causes which I have indicated above, and which principally influence the distribution of heat in diverse periods of the year:",
"such are the distance from the sea, the general form of continents, the direction of winds, etc.",
"These causes continuously modify the precedent results, and establish certain relations of vegetation between distant localities.",
"To complete what relates to this type of botanical arithmetic, as Mr. de Humboldt calls it, and to show up to which point it can paint the general aspect of vegetation of diverse countries, I will say again that one has drawn some parts of the comparison of the proportional number of species and of genera of a country.",
"The more the average number of species of each genus or each family is limited, the more the aspect of vegetation presents varieties;",
"on the contrary, the greater this number, the more a glance at the country presents monotony in forms.",
"The following table makes these results visible for some countries;",
"but it is necessary to observe here how little these results offer true certainty.",
"They are, in fact, modified by the more or less great tendency of the authors to divide the genera, or to distinguish more species;",
"they are modified further by another circumstance, that, in the countries that are studied often, the species were all distinguished, while some are more often confused with others when it comes to the question of foreign plants.",
"In the middle of uncertainties of this kind of calculation, it is difficult not to notice that it is in the isolated islands that the number of species of each genus is proportionally the smallest:",
"so I limit myself to record here, in waiting for the more exact results.",
"I sought to prove up to this point that habitations considered as a whole seem to be determined by the temperature.",
"Without doubt, one must combine with it the considerations deduced from stations;",
"for, it is clear that, the more a country is sandy, the more one will find there the plants of sands, etc.",
"But, even if one gives to these causes every freedom one can attribute to them, can one succeed at rendering complete reason for the best-known facts?",
"It is this I doubt, and which requires a new discussion.",
"It is perhaps not difficult to find two points in the United States and Europe, or in equinoctial America and equinoctial Africa, which present all the same circumstances, that is, a same temperature, a same height, a same soil, an equal dose of humidity;",
"however, almost all, maybe all plants are different in these two similar localities:",
"one could well find a certain analogy of appearance and even of structure between the plants of these two supposed localities;",
"but in general these would be different species.",
"It seems, thus, that the circumstances other than those which determine the stations today have influenced the habitations.",
"Before discussing this question, let us establish first the facts independently of any theory.",
"When one compares between diverse parts of the world separated by vast seas, one finds great differences in the selection of plants;",
"but there are also some common plants.",
"If it concerns the boreal hemisphere, one finds these common species in several regions, principally towards the pole, where all these countries are united or very close to each other.",
"One further finds them here and there in the rest of the two continents;",
"but, if one disregards the species which appear to have been transported by man, their number will always diminish as one approaches southern regions, where the distance between continents become greater:",
"thus, among the 2891 phanerogamic species described by Pursh in the United States, one finds 385 which are found in northern or temperate Europe, and among this number, as Mr. de Humboldt observed, there are many which it is difficult to believe to have been transported by man;",
"such are satyrium viride, betula nana, etc.",
"On the contrary, Mr. de Humboldt and Mr. Bonpland found, in all their voyages in the equinoctial America, only about twenty-four species (all cyporaceae or grasses) which were common to America and to some part of the Old World.",
"The number of acotyledons common to the two continents is more considerable (at least as much as the difficulty of distinguishing the species in this class permits to affirm it.)",
"But the proportions appear the same, that is, there are more species common to the two continents towards the north than towards the south.",
"If one compares New Holland with Europe, one finds, according to Mr. Brown, that, of 4100 known species in this southern land, there are 166 which it shares with Europe.",
"Of this number, 15 are dicotyledons, 32 monocotyledons, and 119 acotyledons.",
"Among the first two classes, there are many that one can suspect of having been transported by man;",
"but there are some, such as potamogetons, for which this speculation seems to be little founded.",
"The number of species common to the parts of the old continent that are far apart from each other is perhaps a bit more considerable than in the two examples that I have just cited;",
"but it is still very limited:",
"one should in fact be very wary, in the researches of this kind, of the ancient flora;",
"it is only recent that botanists have felt the importance of this question, and have paid sufficient attention to the examination of these plants that are said to be common to diverse countries.",
"The first voyagers believed that the plants of their country would always be found in distant countries, and happily gave them their names.",
"As soon as they brought back the specimens to Europe, the illusion dissipated for the greatest number:",
"when the sight of dry specimens left further doubts, the cultivation in gardens raised them, and there remains today (except the plants transported by the influence of man) a very small number of phanerogamic species that are common to diverse continents.",
"Thus, New Holland has 1/80, equinoctial America 1/134 of its species that are shared with Europe, and still less with the rest of the world.",
"Before assigning importance to this small number of species common to distant regions, it should be examined what the diverse means by which the seeds can be transported from a country into another are.",
"If it is a question about a step by step transportation, it suffices that the circumstances necessary to the life of the species are not interrupted, or, in other terms, that the transportation does not encounter the path of spaces in which the vegetation of this or that species becomes impossible.",
"These natural barriers to transportation of plants are of diverse kinds.",
"1° The seas are the all the more powerful obstacles to the propagation of plants as they are more stretched out.",
"Thus, island plants share the vegetation of the nearby continents, roughly in inverse proportion of their distance:",
"for example, in making exception of the plants that have been evidently naturalized, one finds that, among 1485 vascular plants which grow in the British Isles, there are only 43 or 1/34 which have been found also in France;",
"among 533 species, the Canary Islands offer 310, or about 28/34, which were not found on the continent of Africa, and the flora of Saint Helena presents hardly two or three species which were found in one of the two neighboring continents.",
"The seas block the transportation of plants by their extent and by the deleterious influence of the salt water on the seeds subject to its action.",
"Thus, the seeds of lodoicea from Seychelles, transported by the currents of Maldives, as Mr. Labillardière saw it, or those of mimosa scandens and dolichos urens, transported from West Indies to Hebrides, as I learned from Mr. Louis Necker, arrive in these distant countries, deprived of the faculty of germination.",
"But, when we have proven examples of seeds regularly transported to such distances, when we have strong probabilities to believe that the deleterious action of salt water does not act on all seeds in same degrees, when we see the islands offer so often the plants similar to those of nearby sides, can we doubt that a certain number of species could have been and are thus transported by the sea from a region to another, and prosper when the plants there meet a climate that conforms to their needs?",
"This transportation, which is very difficult when the seas are too vast, becomes easier when there are some series of islands between two continents, which serve for the seeds as stepping stones:",
"thus, the Aleutian Islands establish a communication between the northern Asia and America;",
"also, almost all plants collected until present day in these islands are among the species common to the old and new continents.",
"There are the seas which seem to have prevented the passage of plants less than others;",
"such is, for example, the Mediterranean Sea, which presents on its two borders an almost the same vegetation:",
"of 1577 species observed by Mr. Desfontaines in Barbary, there are only about 300, hardly 1/5, which had not been found in Europe.",
"This phenomenon can be due to either the multitude of islands which are dispersed in this sea, or to the fact that it has been traveled by navigators longer than any other, or maybe that it originated from some eruption of the ocean after the origin of the vegetation.",
"2° The second kind of natural limits for the transportation of plants is determined by the vast and continuous deserts so that the seeds can be only with difficulty transported from a side to another:",
"it is thus that the arid and scorching sands of Sahara offer a barrier that is almost impossible to cross, and establish a great difference between the plants of the two parts of Africa separated by the desert.",
"Excluding the plants transported evidently by man, one can hardly find in the Atlantic flora some species which had been observed in Senegal.",
"The briny steppes of the western Asia produce an analogous effect, but in a less pronounced manner because they are more interrupted, and less general, since there is a certain number of plant species which can still live in this briny water.",
"3° A third kind of limits is determined by the great chains of mountains:",
"these can influence either because, being covered by eternal snow, they offer an obstacle to the propagation of seeds, or because the brusque difference of temperature caused by their elevation prevents certain species from propagating on one side or another.",
"But it must be remarked that this kind of limits is very imperfect, compared to the two precedents.",
"The chains of mountains are always interrupted by more or less deep fissures, which permit plants to spread from one side to another:",
"thus, it is well observed in France that some plants of Midi escape across the valleys of the Alps or Cévennes, and are found on the other/southern side of these two chains, principally in the places where they are lower or more interrupted.",
"Finally, every continuous obstacle to the vegetation of any species prevents it from propagating in a certain direction:",
"a big marsh is a limit for the plants which fear water;",
"a big forest for those which fear shade;",
"a change in latitude or elevation for those which fear coldness.",
"Plants are, in varying degrees, endowed with the faculty of overcoming these limits, and it is very important, for the question we are concerned with, to take a general idea of these means of transportation, be they natural or artificial.",
"1° The movements of water frequently transport the seeds of riverside plants;",
"I have already mentioned of those that sea currents carry around with water:",
"but the rivers produce this effect in a more sound manner because still water harms the germinating faculty less than salty water does;",
"thus, one often sees the alpine plants grow along the course of rivers which descend the Alps.",
"But, by assigning all possible importance to this transportation of seeds by water, one can hardly explain how the seeds of aquatic plants can be transported from a pond/basin into another.",
"How, for example, can aldrovanda be found in Po basin and in Rhone basin?",
"If these facts were rare, one could admit some accidental causes;",
"but aquatic plants, which have less chance than others of being transported by wind, man, or animals, are mostly dispersed in diverse regions.",
"Is this fact not a consequence and a new proof of inundations or deluges, which, by covering part of lands with water, could transport and depose here and there the seeds of aquatic plants?",
"It is difficult to understand otherwise the existence of fish and other animals of freshwater in the lakes with no connection with each other;",
"and the same explanation, applied to the two kingdoms of organisms, becomes more probable for one and the other, and less immense relative to the special fact to which I had applied it first.",
"Thus, waters, whether in their current state or in the old state whose phenomena testify reality, contribute to explaining the dispersion of certain species of plants.",
"2° The atmosphere can also contribute to the same phenomenon:",
"we have a direct proof for it in certain waterspouts, which sometimes transport the seeds of diverse plants to great distances;",
"we see all the time the winds transporting here and there the seeds which, by their small size or by their wings and aigrettes, easily get ready for action.",
"But, apart from the facts of this kind, so trivial that nobody thinks of contesting them, there are others which should perhaps be related to the same cause.",
"The seeds or germs of cryptogams are of such a small dimension and of such a light weight, that we see them being carried in the air, like molecules of impalpable dusts which constantly float in the atmosphere.",
"One can conceive that these seeds are thus transported to great distances, without this hypothesis contradicting the laws of physics nor even those of simple probabilities.",
"Thus, the winds which blow for a long time in certain directions should be carrying certain species of cryptogams;",
"I would almost dare to cite an example:",
"the coast of Brittany is usually beaten by the winds of south-west, and I found two lichens on the trees from the walk in Quimper-Corentin (sticta crocaia and physcia flavicans) which still have not been found except in Jamaica and which is not found in the rest of France.",
"3° The animals further contribute to transporting seeds from one region to another.",
"The seeds which, like xanthium spinosum or gallium aparine, are equipped with hooks or thorns attach themselves to the animal hairs, and are thus carried outside of their native soil;",
"those which are bordered by fleshy pericarps, which certain birds eat, often resist the effect of digestion, and are sown here and there with these birds’ excrements:",
"the manner in which thrushes sow the mistletoes can give an example.",
"The migrations of birds to considerable distances, and even across the seas, can in some cases transport seeds far away.",
"4° Finally, man plays such an important and active role on the earth, that he continuously modifies its surface, and his action, whether voluntary or involuntary, is made felt on most of bodies of nature.",
"He is spread in the entire world, and transported everywhere with him the plants which he cultivates for his needs.",
"When the introduction of these cultures is recent, one has no doubt about their origin;",
"but, when it is ancient, one ignores the true origin of these nourishing plants.",
"Thus, nobody contests the American origin of corn or potato any more than the origin in the ancient world of coffee or wheat.",
"But there are certain cultivated objects of very ancient origin in the tropics, such as banana tree, whose origin is not recognized:",
"sometimes one of the continents supplies it to another;",
"sometimes both continents possess analogous species, which are today confused under the name of varieties.",
"One can see, in the beautiful memoir of Mr. Brown on the plants of Congo, by which kind of reasoning and analogies one can sort out truth concerning these ancient naturalizations.",
"Among those which are more recent, there are some that are still difficult to consider:",
"it is thus that the slaves, pulled away from Africa by the avid activity of Europeans and transported to the American colonies, brought there some fruit trees and useful plants from their country;",
"it is thus that we have seen in our days the armies carrying here and there the seeds and manners of cultivation from one extremity of Europe to another, and thus showing us how in the ancient times the conquests of Alexander, Roman expeditions, and crusades could transport several plants from one part of the world to another.",
"But, apart from the plants he cultivates, man carries plants constantly with him, that he spreads all over the world without suspecting it and sometimes against his will:",
"thus, all harmful herbs which grow in the middle of our cereals and which perhaps we have received from Asia with them, we have introduced them ourselves to every part of the globe;",
"thus, with the wheat from Barbary, the inhabitants of southern Europe have sown for many centuries the plants from Algeria and Tunis;",
"thus, with wools and cottons from the Orient or Barbary, one frequently brings to France the seeds of exotic plants, some of which are naturalized.",
"I will cite a striking example.",
"There is at the gates of Montpellier a prairie consecrated for drying foreign wools after they are washed:",
"it is hardly a year past that the foreign plants are found naturalized in this field of wools;",
"I have collected there psoralea palaestina, hypericum crispum, centaurea parviflora, etc.",
"One sees likewise, in some marine towns, the foreign plants naturalized by the ballasts of ships:",
"Bonamy cites several of them sown in this manner in the vicinity of Nantes;",
"Datura stramonium, senebiera pinnatifida, etc. could well have been introduced to Europe in this manner.",
"Finally, the botanic gardens, where so many diverse plants come together, become so many centers of naturalization:",
"thus, erigeron canadense, phytolacca decandra, etc., which seem to have emerged from them, are today more common in Europe than many of indigenous plants;",
"thus, we have seen recently, at the gates of Geneva, veronica filiformis being naturalized around a particular botanic garden.",
"In our countries that have been civilized for a long time, not very favorable to vegetation and constantly cleared of inutile plants by agriculture, these kinds of chance naturalization are achieved only slowly, and a great number of plants thus propagated perish without posterity;",
"but in hot, badly cultivated countries, these naturalizations become very easy.",
"Thus, Mr. Burchell saw chenopodium ambrosioides, which he himself saw being sown on Saint Helena, multiply in four years to the point of becoming one of the harmful, most common herbs.",
"One finds an experimental proof of these naturalizations that man makes without knowing it, in the very comparison of plants which are found at great distances:",
"thus, in New Holland, in America, at the Cape of Good Hope, one finds more species that originated from Europe than any other part of the world;",
"hence one sees that the influence of man prevails over that of purely physical causes in this case.",
"The countries in which one lands for the first time present in general only the truly indigenous species, and, as the commercial relations multiply, one sees increasing number of European plants or plants that are common to diverse continents.",
"Let us hasten, thus, while there is still time, to make/record the exact flora of distant countries;",
"let us above all recommend to voyagers those of islands that have not been frequented by Europeans:",
"it is in their study that the solution of a crowd of questions on plant geography must be found.",
"If one reflects now on the perpetual action of the four causes of transportation of seeds that I have indicated—water, wind, animals, and man—one will find, I think, that they are quite sufficient for explaining a small number of plants that one finds alike in diverse continents.",
"The first is applied particularly to aquatic plants, the second to cryptogams, the last two to ordinary phanerogams.",
"Their slow, simultaneous, continuous, and imperceptible action constantly tends to transport plants in all sorts of ways, and these plants are naturalized where they encounter circumstances that are favorable to their existence.",
"From the ensemble of these facts, one can thus deduce that there exist botanic regions:",
"I designate under this term any space which, if one makes exception for the introduced species, offer a certain number of plants which are particular to them and which one could truly name aboriginal.",
"The plants from a region are distributed according to their nature in the localities that are agreeable to them, and they tend to, with more or less energy, overcome their limits and to propagate in the entire world;",
"but they are mostly stopped either by the seas, deserts, or changes in temperature, or only because they come to encounter the spaces already occupied by the plants from another region.",
"There are thus perfectly circumscribed and determined regions;",
"there are others which one can understand only by a certain ensemble or a certain mass of common/shared plants.",
"We are still far from being able to apply these principles with exactitude;",
"but one can however already catch a glimpse of some of these regions, in such a way that calls attention of voyagers to these researches.",
"Here are roughly those which are presented to me in the current state of our knowledge.",
"1° The hyperborean region [extreme north], which includes the northern extremities of Asia, Europe, and America, and which are frequently confused with the following.",
"2° The European region, which includes all of Europe, except the parts neighboring the pole, and those which surround the Mediterranean:",
"it extends to east roughly up to the Altai mountains.",
"3° The Siberian region, where I include the great plateau of Siberia and of Tartary.",
"638 4° The Mediterranean region, which includes all of geographic basin of the Mediterranean; that is: part of Africa below Sahara, and part of Europe which is sheltered from north by a more or less continuous chain of mountains.",
"5° The Oriental region, thus termed relative to the southern Europe, and which includes the countries neighboring the Black Sea and the Caspian Sea.",
"6° India with its archipelago.",
"7° China, Cochinchina, and Japan.",
"8° New Holland.",
"9° The Cape of Good Hope, or the southern extremity of Africa, outside of the tropics.",
"10° Al-Habash, Nubia, and the coasts of Mozambique, on which sufficient information is lacking.",
"11° The vicinities of Congo, Senegal, and Nigeria, or equinoctial and western Africa.",
"12° The Canary Islands.",
"13° The northern United States of America.",
"14° The west coast of temperate, northern America.",
"15° The West Indies.",
"16° Mexico.",
"17° The part of southern America, situated between the tropics.",
"18° Chile.",
"19° Southern Brasil and Buenos Aires.",
"20° South America [terres Magellaniques].",
"Finally, one must add to this general indication each of the islands which is quite isolated from all other continents, to present a selection of plants which is unique to it.",
"Botanists know that generally the plants of these twenty regions are different from each other, such that, when one finds in the writings of voyagers the plants of one of these regions which one says had been found in another region, one must, before accepting this proposition, study the samples from the two countries with a very particular care.",
"To consider this division of the globe only as a precaution in synonymy and determination of species, it would already serve some utility;",
"but it serves above all to express under a bit more general form the immense multitude of facts concerning the motherlands of plants.",
"Among the general phenomena which the habitation of plants presents, there is one which seems to me more inexplicable than all others:",
"it is that there are certain genera, certain families, all of whose species grow in a single country (I will call them, by analogy with the medical language, endemic genus/type), and others whose species are distributed all over the world (I will call them, by an analogous motif, sporadic genus/type).",
"Thus, although very numerous, all species of the genera Hermannia, Manulea, Borbonia, Cluytia, Antholiza, Gorteria, etc. are native to the Cape of Good Hope;",
"those of Banksia, Styphelia, Goodenia, etc., to New Holland;",
"those of Mutisia, Cinchona, Fuchsia Cactus, Tillandsia, etc., to equatorial America:",
"while on the contrary majority of genera have species which grow spontaneously in very diverse countries.",
"Some families even seem to be assigned to certain regions:",
"thus, hespéridées are all from India or China;",
"labiatiflores from southern America;",
"epacrideceae from Australasia.",
"But nothing seems very regular in this disposition of species on the globe.",
"Thus, for example, we possess in Europe certain species of very numerous genera, and of which all other species are native to some other region.",
"All of passiflora inhabit America, except one, discovered recently in the southern extremity of America by Mr. Burchell.",
"All of mesembryanthemum inhabit the Cape of Good Hope, except M. nodiflorum and copticum, which are found in Corsica and Barbary;",
"all of ixia, except ixia bulbocodium, common in our southern coasts;",
"all of gladiolus, except gladiolus communis, so common in our crops;",
"all heathers, in number of two or three hundred species, except five to six which are found in Europe;",
"almost all wood sorrels, except three wild species in France and some in America.",
"These deseeded[égrenées] species, which are readily compared to the soldiers separated from their regimens, were the causes for which botanists have for so long time neglected the study of natural orders:",
"it is necessary that the exotic botany be very advanced so that one could recognize their affinities;",
"for they seemed to escape all laws, when these laws were established only based on the European families.",
"Moreover, this more or less regular disposition of species and families on the globe is a known fact, but it is today absolutely impossible to reduce to some theory.",
"Another quite remarkable fact which is presented in the comparison of regions is that certain countries which never or almost never offer alike species give birth to the analogous species, that is, belonging to the same genus.",
"Thus, for example, the United States of America present a great number of similar genera to those of the Old World:",
"sometimes the species are divided between the United States and Europe, as, for example, in the genera Fraxinus, Populus, Pinus, Tilia;",
"sometimes between the United States and Asia, as in the genera Juglans, Magnolia, Vitis;",
"sometimes between three regions, as for the genera Acer, Salix, Delphinium, etc.",
"This phenomenon is presented in a more curious manner when it concerns the genera that are not numerous in species:",
"thus, for example, we know in the entire world only two liquidambars, two panax[ginseng], two plane trees, two stillingia, two planera;",
"one of the species of each genus inhabits East Asia, another South America:",
"we know only two majanthemum, two vallisneria, two ostrya, two sweet chestnuts, two hipophae, one of the species in Europe, another in the United States:",
"we know only three species of larix, carpinus, trollies, one in Europe, the second in Siberia, the third in the United States.",
"What I have just said regarding the three principal regions of the temperate part of the northern hemisphere is equally true of three equatorial regions;",
"thus, one finds analogous species between the tropics—Asia, Africa, and America—but never alike species between them:",
"for example, the species of the genera Cratoeva, Bertiera, Eloeis, etc. are divided between the equatorial America and Africa;",
"those of the genera Sagus, Strophranthus, etc., between the equatorial Asia and Africa;",
"those of the genera Psychotria, Begonia, etc., between the equatorial America and Asia;",
"those of the genera Melastoma, Stercutia, Jussieua, between the three equatorial regions.",
"We know in the entire world only two cytinus, one in the Mediterranean region, the other in Mexico;",
"two sphenoclea, one in Malabar and the other in Mexico;",
"two melothria, one in Guinea, the other in the West Indies;",
"two sauvagesia, one Cayenne, the other in Madagascar, etc.",
"The same analogy is perceived also between the regions of the southern hemisphere, but in a less marked manner, either because the seas occupy a proportionally greater part there, or above all because we know less the details of their local botany.",
"If we compare the analogous regions of the two hemispheres, we will find there likewise some quite remarkable relations:",
"thus, the species of the genera Caltha, Empetrum, etc. are found in the coldest parts of the two hemispheres, and absent in all intermediate space;",
"the species of the genera Oxalis, Passerina, etc. are found in the temperate regions of the two hemispheres, and absent in the intermediate spaces;",
"hypoxis even offer a singular [example], that a part of the species grows in the temperate southern region of the Old World, and another only in the temperate northern region of the New World.",
"Finally, certain regions present still more particular analogies, and which I would say willingly more mysterious.",
"For example, certain genera that are quite numerous in species are divided between the Cape of Good Hope and the Cape Maria Van Diemen;",
"such are pelargonium, protea, etc.",
"The region of the Canary islands and that of Europe offer a great number of alike genera, but which have this particularity that the herbaceous species are in Europe, and the woody species in Canaries:",
"thus, one finds in this region sonchus, prenanthes, convolvulus, echium, which are shrubs and almost trees;",
"the Saint Helena island, whose forests are the species of solidago, is, under this relation, analogous to the Canaries.",
"It seems at first glance, and this idea is so seductive that it is almost popular, that these species are the same as ours, having become woody by their journey in a hot climate;",
"but that is not the case:",
"the woody species of the Canaries remain woody in our colder climates;",
"our herbaceous species do not become woody in hot countries, or at least those which are mildly susceptible of it do not become woody more in the Canaries than elsewhere.",
"Let us observe, in fact, to better grasp this particular character of the vegetation of the Canaries, that other equally hot regions likewise share some species with Europe, but which are herbaceous there as in our place:",
"thus, sonchus and echium of Egypt, convolvulus of Egypt and of India, are herbaceous and not woody as in the Canaries.",
"These relations of certain countries with each other undoubtedly tend to the resemblances of localities that are sometimes appreciable, sometime unknown;",
"but even in the latter case, they can serve as a guide in naturalizations.",
"Moreover, everything we have just said of regions should be understood only regarding wild plants;",
"for, as soon as the seeds of a species find, wherever that be, an agreeable climate and soil, they can grow there as in their native soil.",
"This fact brings us to the idea that has already been indicated above, that is, that the stations uniquely tend to the currently active physical causes, and that the habitations seem to have been partly determined by the geological causes which no longer exist today.",
"In this hypothesis, one would conceive easily why certain plants are never found in wild state in the places where they arrive, perfectly as soon as they are brought there.",
"But this theory contributes, it should be admitted, to the incertitude of all ideas concerning the ancient state of our globe and concerning the primitive origin of organized beings.",
"Under the first relation, one could ask, with some physicians, if the most elevated parts of the globe, having been the first to be uncovered by water, were not the first to be populated with plants, and serve as the center from where plants would have dispersed to all corners.",
"This hypothesis would rather conform to the idea of regions;",
"but the difference of temperature of plains and mountains, as well as the circumstance, observed earlier, that certain chains of mountains seem to rather serve as limits than as centers of vegetation, prevents assigning too much importance to this idea, which the celebrated Willdenow seemed to have admitted.",
"One would say, like some other naturalists, that the primitive terrains had first to be covered with plants, these having to precede the development of animals, and consequently the formation of secondary terrains?",
"In this idea, the primitive parts of the globe had to be the centers of regions;",
"but, as well as it is difficult to recognize the traces of this dispersion, it is very doubtful that the species of plants which grow today are the same as those which must have existed before the second terrains, and whose imprints or debris we find in these terrains.",
"This curious study, started not long ago, at least with some exactitude, by Mr. de Sternberg, and which Mr. Adolphe Brongniart, as young as he is, already seemed destined to improve;",
"this study, I say, seems to indicate that our plant species are different from the antediluvian species, and that, consequently, there were a development of a new vegetation since the formation of the secondary terrains.",
"What would it be, if from these purely geological considerations we were to pass to those which belong to the bases, and I would gladly say, to metaphysics of the natural history?",
"Every theory of botanical geography is based on the idea that one has of the origin of organized beings and of the permanence of species.",
"I will not undertake to discuss here these two fundamental, and perhaps unsolvable, questions;",
"but I cannot dispense with remarking on their relations with the study of the distribution of plants.",
"Every article which one has read were written in following the opinion that the species of organized beings are permanent, and that every living individual comes from another being alike to it:",
"I sought to show that, in following this opinion, to which all certain facts lead us, and which one attacks only by combining the consequences of doubtful or ambiguous facts, one could explain the greatest part of the geography of plants.",
"If we come to say that the permanence of species is not proven, I will respond that it is proven at least in certain limits:",
"if one comes to find that two or three neighboring plants, taken for species, are varieties, we shall only extend the limits which circumscribe this or that species;",
"but the very idea of species will not be altered.",
"From the fact that botanists have sometimes admitted too many species because they placed too much importance on the characters deduced from the most visible, but the least essential parts of the organs of vegetation, can one reasonably conclude that the organs of fructification share the same incertitude, and that there do not exist fixed/permanent species?",
"I do not think so, and I do not see that even those who support these ideas actually follow them.",
"Most are obliged to agree that at least in the beings of complicated organization, when once the types of species are fixed, they are constant in the given limits:",
"it is what is observed in all beings of the two organized kingdoms whose anatomy is well known.",
"But what proof does one have that it would be otherwise in the beings with less distinct and less well known organs?",
"One would have readily supported, before Hedwig, that there did not exist constant species in the foams;",
"today one is obliged to resort to mushrooms and seaweed, to cite the examples that one could not argue with error in the first examination.",
"It is a singular logic where one deliberately neglects the consequences of all well-known facts, to establish the general theories on not well-known facts that are limited to a small number of beings!",
"The most frequent similarity of cryptogams in diverse, distant countries seemed like an argument in favor of their production by external elements;",
"but we have seen that one can explain it by the permanent agitation of atmosphere;",
"and the partisans of spontaneous formations seemed to me, on the contrary, unable to explain the general and incontestable fact, that a great number of well-determined species are found only in one region, and are not found in wild state in the countries where all circumstances are favorable to them and where they fare very well when sown there.",
"Up to present, varieties of plants seem to range under two main generalities:",
"those which are produced by current external elements and which are modifiable by the contrary circumstances, and those which are formed by hybridity and which the external circumstances do not seem to alter.",
"The constant differences of plants emerging in diverse regions seem to relate neither to one nor to the other of these classes:",
"one cannot attribute them to external circumstances, for other circumstances do not destroy them;",
"one cannot attribute them to hybridity, for hybridity or increase of races necessarily suppose rapprochement of analogous beings.",
"I understand very well, although I do not completely share this opinion, and I admit, in some case, that, in a country where many species of the same genus are found close to each other, hybrid species can be formed, and I sense that it can explain a great number of species of certain genera that are found in certain regions;",
"but I do not conceive how one could support the same explanation for the species which live naturally at great distances.",
"If larch trees that are known in the world live in the same places, I could believe that one of them is the product of the interbreeding of the two others;",
"but I cannot admit that, for example, the species of Siberia was produced by the interbreeding of those of Europe and America.",
"Thus, I see that there exist permanent differences in organized beings, which cannot be attributed to any of the present causes of variations;",
"it is these differences which constitute the species:",
"these species are distributed on the globe partly according to the laws that one can immediately deduce from the combination of the known laws of physiology and physics, partly according to the laws which seem to belong to the origin of things and which are unknown to us.",
"Such is, in summary, the point where botanical geography is obliged to stop.",
"Let us not lose the view that this science could begin only when the study of species was rather advanced to provide it with numerous and certified facts, and that, on the other hand, it is important to study it a lot, in order to establish its bases before the relations of commerce, naturalizations, voyages, and cultivations in gardens have ended up conflating all regions with each other, and sometimes even connected species among themselves by intermediate productions.",
"To give an idea of the real degrees of confidence that one can accord the results of acquired knowledge today, and of the number of species which remain to be discovered to be able to establish the geography of plants on the real knowledge of species, I will conclude this article by recalling an approximate calculation which I mentioned elsewhere (Biblioth. Univ. des sciences, vol.6, p.119), on the proportional number of known species and of those which remain to be discovered on the globe.",
"The most complete catalogue of the vegetable kingdom that we possess today, Enchiridium by Mr. Persoon, contains 21,000 species, without counting the cryptogams, which can be estimated as 6,000.",
"Since then the major works of Mr. Brown, Mr. de Humboldt, Mr. Pursh, etc. have made known several thousands of them, and there exists, in the collections of naturalists, a considerable number of plants which, although not described, cannot be considered as unknown.",
"To have an approximate idea of the total number of species, either described or assembled into the collections, I compared the number of species of the families of which I was lastly called to write monographies, to the number that the same genera present in [Christiaan Hendrik] Persoon;",
"here is the result of this comparison.",
"If diverse botanists thus engage simultaneously in the same work on all families of the vegetable kingdom, 27,000 species indicated in Persoon’s work would be inclined to 56,000.",
"It is, in fact, not at all probable that there has been in books and in modern collections more increases in these twelve families than in all others;",
"the greatest portion of this calculation is even based on two European families and which one believed to be the best known.",
"In limiting myself to say that the number of species described or observed in the collections is of 56,000, I am probably below and not above the truth.",
"But what proportion of the real number of plants on the globe do these 56,000 species, already acquired for science, represent?",
"If one calculates that it has been thirty years that the greatest number have been collected, if one compares the proportional number of European and foreign species, if, lastly, one tries to form an idea of the extent of the countries that have been little or not at all traveled by botanists and of the number of plants they must hold, one arrives by these diverse paths to this same result, that it is probable that we have collected only half of the plants on the globe, and that consequently the total number of species can be evaluated between 110,000 and 120,000:",
"immense number, which proves the admirable fecundity of nature;",
"which demonstrates the necessity of improving, as much as possible, the methods of natural classification;",
"which must, finally, show voyagers and botanists that there remain many to collect and to observe in all countries of the world.",
"From what has preceded, one sees that the laws of botanical geography are hardly established except on the incomplete knowledge of a quarter of the plants on the globe.",
"This number, as limited it is, can suffice to give an idea of the theory of stations because the study of a single region is sufficient to explain a crowd of facts common to all regions;",
"but, for the theory of habitations, we need numerous and exact researches.",
"The works which, for advancing this part of science, seems most worthy to be recommended to observers, are the followings.",
"It is important first to multiply the local Flora in different points of the globe, carefully applying more precision than has generally been done to the geographical limits of space from which one describes vegetation, to absolute elevations where plants live in diverse localities, and to the usual state of background or elements which can influence vegetation.",
"The flora of islands offer in particular a real interest, either by the bizarreness they present, or because the work, being circumscribed, can be done with exactitude.",
"It is important that the voyagers are not content with just noting that they found such known species in such places, but that they record samples which could certify its identity.",
"It is further desired that they note carefully the local circumstances which can permit assuming whether the species is indigenous or it was naturalized; whether it lives in society or in isolation, whether it is abundant or rare in the country:",
"in a word, the precise and varying details on the stations and habitations of plants are absolutely necessary to give a more certain progress to botanical geography.",
"I dare to recommend these researches to voyagers:",
"it is, I repeat, the moment of doing it before the civilization changes the surface of the globe too much.",
"As for the sedentary botanists, their role for the advancement of botanical geography is to compare all the results obtained by voyagers, to deduce generalities from it.",
"It would be very valuable to facilitate this work, that some exact and laborious scholar wished to consult all Floras already published, and arrange them in the order of natural families, to be able to profit, without too much time loss, from the documents already acquired by the laborious activity of naturalists.",
"I do not doubt that a such work would arise in the mind of one who would undertake a crowd of new ideas and ingenious relations.",
"It would be further singularly useful to this kind of researches and to many other branches of sciences, that one publishes at last an exact and complete resume of acquired knowledges on the current state of physical geography and of this part of general physics which truly forms part of geography.",
"For quite a long time, in the elementary books consecrated to this study, we have seen only the political divisions and works of men;",
"it is about time that we own some volumes, either methodical or even alphabetical, on the very nature of diverse countries.",
"If, in forming these wishes/resolutions, I could determine some scholar to execute these works, I would have undoubtedly contributed more to the advancement of botanical geography than by the imperfect sketch which I have just presented."

sentence,
"It has been said for a long time that science is art of becoming or of foreseeing:",
"this statement, which can seem absurd at first, and which would have been absurd in the sense it was stated, has become completely true, if one means by it that the least equivocal proof of progress of science is that science could determine in advance the result of experiences which have not happened;",
"so, the calculation of an eclipse, the plan of a machine, and the prognosis of a diseases, are as much demonstrative predictions as astronomy, physics, medicine are real sciences.",
"This faculty of determining the unknown by the known seems an accompaniment of sciences, where one always proceeds by relations of effect and cause, and where the faculty was first developed:",
"it was recognized later that this same faculty can exist in studies which, like natural history, seem nothing but a reunion of isolated facts;",
"thus, by studying organization, one has recognized first that certain organs are present or lacking always simultaneously, such that the presence of one of them is a rather certain indication of the existence of others:",
"one then recognized that organs exercise on the rest of the organization a such force that, from the disposition of a single part, one can deduce the form of many other parts of the individual;",
"these two principles founded the theory of natural families, and from this moment, natural history was elevated to the rank of science." ",
"Under this point of view, it must be agreed that the study of medical material, although most immediately useful among human knowledges, is one that is furthest away from perfection;",
"in fact, this perfection would be achieved only when one is able to resolve this problem: given a natural material, how to determine a priori the effect that each of its parts would have on the human body when applied in given circumstances?",
"The first attempts were for a long time the experiences by chance, and science consisted only of the collection of isolated facts.",
"It is really only in the recent centuries that one sought to connect by certain principles the numerous facts that had been observed from experiences or that had been transmitted by traditions.",
"These principles, or to return to my first idea, these means of determining in advance the effect of a medicine can be classified under three main general categories; the sensible qualities, chemical composition, and natural analogy.",
"Without wishing to compare these three means which, subordinated to experience, can lead to truth, I will only stick to developing what can be expected from the latter [natural analogy];",
"I will confine this research regarding the vegetable kingdom, since medical experiences have been more increased on vegetables than on the other two kingdoms, and since the solution to this question, regarding one of the two organic kingdoms, will easily lead to a result analogous to the other kingdom.",
"Most of the ancient authors seemed to believe that plants that resemble each other by their external form also resemble by their properties;",
"one can at least presume it, according to the order in which they most often distribute their medicines, and according to the comparisons which they used to establish among them;",
"the first naturalist-physician who clearly announced this opinion is Camerarius, author of a dissertation de convenientia plantarum in fructificatione et viribus (Tubing, 1699);",
"since then, this opinion has become a regularly controversial subject among physicians and botanists",
"such as Isenflamm (Methodus plantarum medicinae clinicae adminiculum.  Dissertation. Erlang. 1764), Wilcke (De usu systematis sexualis in medicina. Dissertation. Gryphyswalde. 1764), Gmelin (Botanica et chemia ad medicam applicate. Tubing. 1755.  Journ. Phys. I, p.48), and many others were in agreement;",
"but nobody announced as formal an opinion in this regard than Linnaeus in his dissertation on the properties of plants (Amaen. Acad. 5, p.148), where he established that the plants of the same genera have the same properties, that those of the same natural order have similar properties, and that those of the same class also have some relations in their characters;",
"M. de Jussieu adopts the same opinion, and follows an analogous gradation/composition in a memoire (Mémoire de la Société de Médicine. 1786, p.188) on the topic which concerns us, where he applies the principles of his natural classification to this beautiful and grand question.",
"On the other hand, we find Vogel (Mat. Méd. p.12), Plaz (De Plantarum virtutibus ex ipsarum caractere botanico nusquam cognoscendis. 3. Dissertation. Leipzig. 1762 & 1763), and above all Gleditsch (De method botanica dubio et fallacy virtutum in plantis indice. Dissertation.  Francof. 1742), who advance against the possibility of judging the characters of plants according to their external forms and their botanical characters;",
"Cullen (Mat. Méd. I. p.135) even seems to attach little importance to these, although he recognizes the truth of this analogy in a great number of cases, and although he revisits it many times in the course of his medical subject.",
"In the middle of this ambiguity among the most respectable authorities, I have sought to establish my own opinion on this important subject;",
"and if I venture to publish here my reflections, it is because it seemed to me that this discussion has not yet made use of all means that we have given to the recent progresses of natural history, chemistry, and medicine itself, for every medical subject leads to complication of arguments and facts deduced from these three sciences, and it is maybe to this cause that one must attribute what little progress has been made to this day.",
"The question that we are trying to discuss here is not only about pure theory, as one could believe at first glance;",
"it closely concerns the good of humanity and development of natural and medical sciences.",
"It aims to reattach to a trunk all these separate branches of the tree of science;",
"and in the current state of human knowledges, in an epoch where numerous facts are inscribed on the registers of each science, is it without interest and without utility to verify the registers of three sciences, and to draw from them the general results to which one arrives by three different paths?",
"The medical subject is this immense register where medicine, chemistry, and natural history deposit their discoveries:",
"if I dared to trace it in a chapter, I do not conceal that I was neither naturalist, chemist, nor physician, to present any new theory in these three sciences;",
"I have only attempted to compare the results.",
"I will be content if my work can facilitate and clarify the applications of a theory founded by others, but which I believe susceptible to a greater extension.",
"If the principles and exact knowledge of natural families date from a more remote period, we would undoubtedly have been able to indicate already many discoveries of detail due to this theory:",
"some recent examples can at least help us predict them.",
"It is entirely on the law of analogy between properties and external forms that the interesting medical works are based, which have sought to replace exotic medicines with indigenous medicines.",
"Would we have understood well the emetic properties of violets, without ipecacuanha;",
"the purgative characters of morning glories and docks, without scammonia and rhubarb?",
"Would one have attempted in many countries to nourish oneself with leathery root of arum lily, if we misunderstood the useful properties of colocasia?",
"Or to make bread with common acorn, if our fathers had not known the sweet acorn?",
"But let us look beyond our Europe;",
"and in this moment when new centers of civilization are being formed in all quarters, when two Americas, Bengal, New Holland[Australia] offer European colonies now indigenous to these distant nations, let us try to foresee how much physicians and naturalists of these regions can more promptly and more surely be useful to humanity, in guiding their researches on the law of analogy;",
"they quit Europe, enriched with the knowledge of the properties of certain vegetables.",
"Arriving on a new soil, they guide themselves by analogy instead of making attempts by chance;",
"the habitants of India search in rubiaceae a new quinquina [cinchona tree], a new madder, a new ipecacuanha, and they will cease to need to resort to America and Europe.",
"Thus Americans will everyday become more independent of Europe, in making the same usages as we do of analogous vegetables:",
"their oak trees furnish them with tanbark;",
"their pines have turpentine like those of Europe.",
"If there is a country where the theory of analogy between forms and properties can become useful, it is northern America, situated at the same latitude as Europe, and populated with analogous vegetables.",
"But we ourselves can draw a great utility from the research on analogous medicines and aliments among foreign vegetables.",
"We demand it to these voyagers who, far from their home country, exhausted by long navigations, retrieve on a foreign, unknown shore the vegetables which resemble those of our country;",
"it is thus that Forster, discovering a cruciferous vegetable (lepidium oleraceum) in the islands of the South Sea, successfully used it as anti-scorbutic;",
"it is thus that Labillardière, in recognizing a new species of chervil in his voyage around the world, procured for all his travel companions healthy and agreeable food.",
"These applications, which will everyday become more frequent, if the law of analogy is admitted, will also always aim to prove its utility.",
"There are other, less immediate uses, which we will not neglect to mention.",
"Thus, in admitting this theory, one will be able to put in more order and more method in the description and demonstration of medicines;",
"one will be able to presume a priori the place of a medicine whose true origin is unknown:",
"thus, one will place with much probability the ammoniac resin/rubber [gomme ammoniaque] and sagapenum among the products of umbellifers, shea butter among those of laurels, etc.;",
"one will be able to, at last, from the knowledge of properties of plants, deduce consequences relative to their classification;",
"I will have occasion to cite the example of menyanthes, whose febrifugal properties indicate the place in Gentianeae;",
"like this, does not the poisonous root of methonique prove the truth of its relationship with the Colchicaceae?",
"Does not the extreme medicinal difference of the Valerianaceae and the Dipsaceae confirm their separation?",
"Thus one sees that this theory which connects medical and botanical knowledges aims to develop one through the other, to relate these two studies that were formerly closely united that they seem almost inseparable.",
"Thus, let us try to form a precise idea of the degree of confidence it merits.",
"In order to put in some order in the observations that I submit here to the judgment of naturalists and physicians, I will begin with developing the general proofs of analogy which exists between forms and properties of plants, and the laws according to which the exact comparison must be done of forms and properties of vegetables:",
"then I will apply, in my second part, these laws to each particular family.",
"If we first go about by the single theory, from which to derive the properties of diverse substances used in the art of healing, we will be led, in the greatest number of cases, to find their true source in chemical composition.",
"When it is a question of medicines whose nature is well known because it is not complicated, such as spices, serres[?], acids, influence of their compositions cannot be dismissed in doubt, since the least change in this composition inverts the development of their effects.",
"This same law is found in more complicated medicines, such as those whose origin is due to organized bodies;",
"we see that all organic materials are reduced, in the last analysis, to a certain number of substances whose chemical composition is little or not at all varied;",
"and which, when they are brought to their pure state, conserve markedly the same characters;",
"thus starch is always nutritive;",
"rubber and mucilage always softening and relaxing;",
"fixed oil always lubricating;",
"volatile oil stimulating and aromatic, etc.",
"Now, it is evident that these diverse elements mixed in diverse proportions must form the compounds endowed with new properties that are probably intermediary between those of the components;",
"we further conceive that if, in a great number of cases, we cannot explain as clearly the effect of compound medicines, this impossibility concerns much less the nature of things than our own ignorance;",
"but independent of its chemical action, every substance placed in contact with the human body reacts by a simple mechanical effect, such as its weight, its mass, sharpness or smoothness of its surface area, its faculty of absorbing or exhaling humidity, of consuming or retaining calories, etc.;",
"sometimes also this second source of action of foreign substances is the only thing that takes place in certain cases, and it is what happens particularly in medicines applied to the exterior.",
"We see that every effect of medicine on human body must be related either to its physical structure or above all to its chemical composition.",
"But don’t the physical structure, chemical composition of a medicine depend immediately on the organization of the vegetable which produces the medicine, and in particular on the structure of this class of organs which has connection to nutrition?",
"It is a continuously observed phenomenon that diverse plants born in the perfectly similar soil produce very different materials, as much as that the analogous vegetables born in different soils form similar products.",
"Without wishing to reject the influence of soil on the vegetation, one can only dispute that the structure of nutritive organs is not the true cause of the nature of the products, when one sees that when in the same soil under a closed vase containing a quantity of sufficient air, one sows two seeds, one St. John’s wort and the other nettle, at the end of few days will first develop two leaves riddled with small glands filled with essential oil, while the second will carry small tubers full of a caustic liqueur.",
"Can one dispute in doubt the influence of the structure of nutritive organs, when one sees the diverse parts of a vegetable or an animal containing the diversely elaborated juices, endowed with particular properties, and nonetheless all drawn primitively from the same sap or chyle?",
"This influence is so manifest by the diversity of products, that even in the cases where we do not perceive any difference in the organs, we nonetheless view it as proven, when we see it in the results.",
"But, I will say, since it is the structure of nutritive organs which determines the nature of the products of an organized being, it is thus uniquely in these nutritive organs that one must seek the principles of a natural classification;",
"one has followed this path in zoology, and it led to a classification that seemed to conform to nature;" ",
"but in the vegetable kingdom, one has taken the organs of reproduction for the basis of classification, and consequently the nature of vegetable products does not have any necessary relationship with their classification.",
"This objection is too important—it takes too closely to the principles of the true botany and it reemerges so frequently in the course of this work—for me not to hasten to respond to the objection as completely as my means would permit me.",
"It is beyond my subject to demonstrate here, although I believe it is easy to do so, that the difference which is found in the progress of zoology and that of botany is not arbitrary, but has to do with the essential nature of animals and vegetable:",
"one is obliged, for each kingdom, to classify beings according to the function of which organs offer the most variety from species to species, and most constancy from individual to individual;",
"every function, given that one understands it entirely, can lead to a natural classification.",
"This proposition, which could appear risky, will become, I think, at least very probable to those who think that no function is isolated in an organized body, but that each function is modified by the other;",
"above all, to those who will see that, in all organized bodies, we find certain organs whose existence and form are intimately connected, although we still cannot perceive any relation between them.",
"The study of natural relations isn’t anything other than the observation of more or less great constancy of these reunions of organs:",
"according to this principle, the naturalist places beside each other all beings which have the greatest number of common or similar organs, and separates those which possess only a small number of organs in common;",
"hence results that, while perfection of an artificial system is to only complicate the character of classes of the smallest possible number of ideas, a natural method is on the contrary all the more perfect as the characters of classes can express a greater number of ideas.",
"But let us approach the question longer.",
"If it is demonstrated that a natural family contains the plants which have the greatest number of relations in the organs of reproduction, does not the best-founded analogy bring to believe that they would also have relations in the organs of nutrition?",
"We have already seen that, in the animal kingdom, although classes are established according to the organs of nutrition, in taking this term in the most general sense, they correspond nonetheless in a rather extended manner to the organs of generation:",
"like this, we see that, in plants, the most important characters of reproduction, such as the division of vegetables according to whether the seed is acotyledon, monocotyledon, or dicotyledon, is now found to be in agreement with the division by disposition of vessels.",
"If we still cannot state with certitude about such general relations between the secondary characters of fructification and those of nutrition, we nonetheless see them from rather numerous examples, to be authorized to think that these relations truly exist.",
"Thus, when, for several thousands of individuals, we observe, without knowing the cause, that every time a plant has six stamens, of which the two opposites are much shorter than others, it has four petals positioned in cross; we admit as certain the concordance of these two facts;",
"if, for the same number of individuals, we find that leaves are alternating, we admit this second reunion of characters, although drawn from more distant organs, with as much ease as the first, since we are ignorant of the cause of one or the other.",
"It would be easy to multiply infinitely the similar examples:",
"but it seems to me that the considerations I have just presented aim to prove that the structure of organs of reproduction of vegetables can be a rather certain clue to the structure of organs of their nutrition;",
"but if it is true, as I advanced earlier, that the structure of organs of nutrition determines the nature of vegetable products, and consequently its properties, it must be agreed that the properties of plants are in agreement with their classification in natural families.",
"Such is at least the general result of the theory.",
"Let us however abandon this dangerous guide, which, even if it takes the good road, often goes beyond the point where truth is really found, and let us see if simple observation of phenomena would not give us, independently of all experiences, some clues to the properties of plants which resemble each other by the external form.",
"Here the instinct of animals will serve as our guide;",
"among the herbivores one can distinguish two classes; those which nourish themselves with all kinds of vegetables, and those which nourish themselves with only one plant." ",
"Among the first kind, we will observe not the vegetables that they look for, which would be too long, but those which they reject;",
"and we can remark that to the exception of plants which, by their thorns or their hardness, avoid the voracity of animals, animals equally reject or look for all species of a genera or family;",
"thus cows leave alone all Lamiaceae and all Veronicas;",
"horses leave alone almost all cruciferous vegetables;",
"cows, horses, sheep, pigs, goats do not eat almost any Solanée, while they avidly devour grasses, legumes, composites (Linnaeus, Pan Succus).",
"Animals naturally bound to a single food often spread their damages on the species of the same kind or family;",
"insects could provide thousand examples of this kind of instinct;",
"thus, the curculio scrophulariae L., cinips rosae L., psylla juncorum L., curculio rumicis L., cynips salicis, etc. attack many species of kinds from which they carry the name, and some live indifferently on all;",
"thus the precious insect which provides us silk is nourished in diverse countries with the leaves of white mulberries, blackberries, Indian mulberries, Tartan mulberries, redberries.",
"Let us go further, and we will find some insects whose instinct goes beyond the limits of the genera;",
"thus the privet hawk moth lives on privet, ash, lilacs:",
"cabbage butterfly on cabbage, turnip, gillyflowers;",
"caterpillar of papilio Daplidice lives on all plants relating to cabbage and on reseda, the genera most related to cruciferous vegetables that we have in this climate;",
"larva, named by Reaumur as teigne à falbala, has provided me with a striking example of this species of instinct;",
"one never finds it in nature except on the Astragalus with licorice leaves;",
"when I placed these larvae grazing on a tuft of herbs where they could not find any Astragalus, they jumped on other legumes, and did not plants of another family unless when they could not find any legumes to devour.",
"In all these examples which would have been easy to multiply, does not nature seem to tell us herself that the saps of congeneric species enjoy the analogous properties!",
"We will find the same phenomena that animals have just presented, in following the history of plant parasites;",
"here, among real parasites, we can still distinguish those which live indifferently on a great number of plants, like white mistletoe, which grows on almost all trees, and those which nature has determined to live on a single species, a single genera or family;",
"such is, for example, cytinus hypocisiis, which one finds in the middle of France on several species of rock rose shrubs;",
"but in this last class, the most striking example will be drawn from parasite mushrooms, and under this name, I do not mean mushrooms that live on dead trunks or on the bark of living trees, since they draw nothing from the interior of the plant and nourish themselves only with superficial humidity;",
"but I mean these uredinales [rusts], oecidium, pucciniales which are born under the epidermis, nourish themselves with sap of the plant, and are almost entirely strictly bound to a single species.",
"These small vegetables, hardly visible to eyes and comparable to louse or tick of animals, seem to know the natural classification just like insects, and by default of their food, find an analogous aliment in the neighboring species;",
"thus puccinies des rosiers (Puccinia rosae. Fl. fr. Pucc. Mucronate. Pers.), des ronces (Puccinia rubi. Hedw. fil.), des circees (P. circeae. Pers.), des menthes (P. menthae. Pers.), des raiponces (P. phyteumarum. Fl. fr.), treffles (Puccinia trifolii. Hedw. fil.), uredo des rosiers (Uredo rosae. Pers.), des ronces(Uredo rubi. Fl. fr.), aecidium of pine (Aecidium pini. Pers.), violets (Aecidium violarum. Fl. fr.), prenanthes (Aecidium prenanthis. Pers.), tussilago (Aecidium tussilaginis. Pers.), live indifferently on different species of genera from which they carry the name;",
"moreover, the three species (Gymnosporangium conicum. Hedw. fil. - G. fuscum. Fl. fr. – G. clavariae – forme. Fl. fr.) of plants confused under the name of juniper tremella, and which constitute a particular genera, all live on diverse species of junipers, and even attack the foreign junipers that are naturalized in our gardens.",
"Let us go further, and we will find some parasite species on the entire families;",
"thus the sphérie of grasses (Sphaeria graminum. Pers.), uredo des bleds [hole-shaped uridinales] (Uredo segetum. Pers.) and uredo linéaire (Uredo linearis. Pers.) attack all species of grasses of our fields and harvests;",
"uredo mycophila, Pers. is found on many of our big mushrooms;",
"aecidium of borage (Aecidium asperifolii. Pers.), uridinales (Uredo cichoracearum. Fl. fr.), and aecidium des chicoracées (Aecidium cichoracearum. Fl. fr.) grow on almost all indigenous species of these families.",
"By such a great number of examples, does not nature seem, I repeat, to tell us herself that the saps secreted by the plants of the same genera or family are endowed with the same alimentary properties?",
"Observation of natural phenomena has confirmed the results of the theory;",
"but the observation itself which concludes generalities only by analogy needs to be submitted to judgment of the experience, which ultimately decides in physical sciences, just as the judgment of actual usage ultimately decides in the study of languages.",
"This recourse to experience is all the more necessary in this case because in observing the habits of animals, we find all the more exceptions as animals are closer to man.",
"If I first open the history of medical material, I observe that a great number of medicines, even the most effective/active ones, which, in the infancy of science, had been regarded as products of a single plant, are found to belong to many neighboring species when their history is better traced;",
"thus quinquina is drawn from all species of Cinchona, rhubarb from all rheum, opium from several Papaver [poppy family], semen-contra from several absinthium, turpentine from most of pines;",
"thus the better understood history of tragacanth shows us that one draws it from several thorny astragalus, and the same goes for gum-arabic [acacia gum];",
"thus the roots of many violets, tried in diverse places, are found to be emetic, and I believe to have rendered probable that the anti-worm property of helmintochorton is common to many ceramiums.",
"Thus many species of the same genera produce such similar medicines, that one united them under a same name before understanding their history.",
"There are others which, better known because they are indigenous, were always regarded as endowed with the same virtues;",
"thus all mallow plants are emollients, scurvy-grass are anti-scorbutic, gentianaceaes are febrifugal, aconites and hellebores are caustic and dangerous, euphorbias are acrid and purgative, etc.",
"Let us go further, and we will see that, when a well-marked property was recognized in a genera, we discover it to a more or less pronounced degree in other plants of the same family;",
"thus pinkneya, related to quinquina, is, according to Michaux’s testimony, used as febrifugal;",
"many docks participate in purgative properties of rhubarb;",
"many matricarias, milfoils, and tansies with the properties of absinthe, etc.",
"The analogy is sometimes so pronounced that the entire family participates in the same virtues;"
"all grasses have floury and nutritive seeds, and stems full of a more or less sugary sap;",
"labiates are stomachic stimulants and tonics;",
"the umbellifers have tonic seeds;",
"the seeds of euphorbias are acrid and purgative;",
"the sap of conifers is resinous;",
"the bark of amentaceaes is astringent and febrifugal, etc.",
"One can even suspect some similarities in the properties of certain families which resemble each other by their organizations;",
"it is what can be deduced from the relations which exist between the gentianaceaes and the apocinées, the personées and the solanées, the rhodoracées and the ericaceae, the myrtées, the lythraires, and the rosaceae, etc.",
"We add to all these examples that the comparative reading of reports of voyagers prove that the plants of the same genera or family were employed in same usages by the peoples distant from each other without communication;"
"thus the roots of dracaena terminalis are used by Indians for the same usages as those of smilaz sarsaparilla in southern America;",
"thus the bark of rhisophora gymnorhiza serves as black dye in India, and the habitants of Chile use for same purpose the Ionicera corymbosa;",
"thus Eugenia Malaccensis in India, and many myrtles in Peru are used against dysentery;",
"the morning glories from four parts of the world are mostly used as purgatives by different peoples.",
"I will have occasion in the second part to revisit all these examples of uniformity of characters;",
"but we need not conceal that, in the middle of this great number of facts which confirm the theory, there are many striking exceptions:" ",
"the dangerous hemlock is next to the useful carrot, the sweet potato next to the acrid jalap, the bitter apple deceives eyes by its resemblance with melon, the potato is found classified in the middle of poisons, the rye grass among cereals, and the most nearby tree of the cherry tree supplies the most effective poison in the vegetable kingdom.",
"Can one reasonably draw some decisive conclusions when one finds in vegetables such contradictory examples, such strange anomalies?",
"Before seeking to solve them, let us begin by establishing with exactitude the laws according to which the comparison of properties of plants with their external forms must be done.",
"Among the laws that one must observe in solving the question we are concerned with, there are those which are particularly related to botany, others to chemistry, and others to medicine;",
"I will succinctly indicate them, and develop them through some examples.",
"Between these means of reaching truth, the most indispensable means is to try to form a precise idea of natural classification.",
"When one studied species, one grouped in genera those which offered a certain number of shared or similar characters;",
"then, one did the same work on genera, and grouped them into families, according to the analogous principles.",
"When the authors of this vast work wished to pass their results to the mind of other men, they were obliged, for writing their works, to arrange the species in genera, and genera in families, in a continuous series:",
"from this method, maybe necessary for studying, it resulted that many naturalists believed that the natural beings really formed a continuous chain or series where the genera and families formed only the resting points [points de repos];",
"one is even confirmed in this idea by believing to recognize a similar series in the animal kingdom.",
"But nature does not progress like our books;",
"each being finds itself really placed among a certain number of other beings with which it is more or less connected;",
"and the only means of getting an idea of this disposition is to represent the natural beings as placed not in series, but on a geographical map.",
"This idea—indicated by Linnaeus, developed by l’Héritier and Petit-Thouars, and incompletely executed by Gièke and Batsch—is, currently for us, only a metaphor suitable for throwing light on the question that concerns us;" ",
"let us imagine this map executed:",
"the species are large villages;",
"the genera are provinces;",
"the families are empires;"
"the classes are analogous to parts of the world, and the plants that are still isolated are represented by the islands distant from any continent.",
"If, I say, this completely executed map appeared before us, the first thing which would strike our eyes, as in a true geographical map, would be that in certain empires or in certain provinces, the villages are clustered with each other, while in others we would see them apart.",
"This distance tends, as in geography, towards two causes:",
"either that the intermediary beings are still unknown, or else, that nature has indeed placed in the order of beings the empty spaces, here and there, just as she placed on the globe the inhabitable marshes and deserts.",
"Thus here is a first cause of inexactitude, the unequal distance of beings in diverse natural genera or families:",
"one needs no longer be surprised that grasses, labiates, cruciferous vegetables, and malvaceae are closely related by their properties, while caprifoliaceae, rutaceae, urticaceae, and some other families offer anomalies;",
"one is not surprised to see in social order much populated and civilized countries offering uniform customs while the regions that are almost deserted or cut off by rivers and chains of mountains offer great differences.",
"2° Sometimes, in political order, one unites an isolated village or a small island to the nearest province:" ",
"thus in natural order, to avoid multiplicity of divisions, one joins to a genera or family a specie which differs from it by organization;",
"it is what happened when one united ficaria to ranunculus, lamb’s lettuce to valeriana, or the valerians themselves to dipsacaceae, fumaria to papaveraceae, etc.",
"In these cases, if properties are different, it is because the organization differs also, and the exception confirms the law.",
"3° It often happens that such plant which becomes separated, by its properties, from the family or genera in which one has placed it, really belongs to a different family, when its organization is better known;",
"thus, menyanthes, united at first with primulaceae, surprised by its febrifugal properties;",
"Ventenat proved, by the organization of the fruit, that it belongs to the family of gentianae, where the same [febrifugal] character is found.",
"Also, I believe I have erased one of these anomalies, in proving that nenuphar [water lily] is really dicotyledon and relates to the family of papaver [poppies], whose sedative character is related.",
"Analogous observations due to development of science will probably tend towards diminishing the number of known exceptions;",
"and one can already remark in many cases that the plants which become separated from a group by their properties also become distant by their structure;",
"such is quassia among magnolias, pepper plant among urticaceae, walnut tree among terebinthus [thérébinthacées], from which Lamarck has already separated it, etc.",
"Examination of classification has already made disappear the exceptions which seemed contrary to the results that the theory indicated to us;",
"now let us try to determine how one must compare the properties of different plants with each other.",
"It seems necessary to distinguish here the general properties, that is to say, common to all parts of plant, and special properties, that is, particular to one of its juices or any of its organs.",
"As for the first, one does not need to pay but little attention, I think;",
"these general properties are evidently a result of the mixture of all special properties, and uniquely depend on the diverse proportion of the parts of the plant;",
"extremely variable proportion is of little importance to observe under the point of view which we are concerned with."
"If juices from certain vegetables have constant properties, it is because they are composed of certain particular juices whose proportion is more or less fixed in the plant;",
"and in this point of view, they belong to the class of special properties.",
"These latter alone seem to me to be worthy of our attention in the comparison that we are seeking to establish:",
"it is evident that one must place in parallel each organ of a plant with the corresponding organ of another plant;",
"and in this point of view, the more one delves into details, the more one will approach accuracy.",
"So, how many plants do we see that have vastly different properties in their diverse parts?",
"Jussieu offers us a striking example of utility of this exactitude, by showing us that, in the seeds of euphorbia and of many other plants, perisperm is sweet/soft and healthy, while the embryo is acrid and strongly purgative.",
"According to the principle which I have just stated and whose evidence spare proving, we will not compare potato tubers with berries of other solanums, roots of carrots with leaves of hemlocks, and we see already some of the traits disappear which seemed most strongly against analogy;",
"we will see them still diminish, if we follow the consequences of this comparison of organs.",
"1° It is evident that if some plants of a family possess a particular organ which is not at all or very little developed in other plants of the family, we need not be surprised if particular properties of this organ are not found in other plants of the family:",
"thus, if the flesh of vanilla enjoys aromatic properties which are not found in the family of orchids, do we not find its cause, in remarking that the flesh which surrounds their seeds is entirely lacking in other genera of this family?",
"Would it not be the same for the sweet/soft and laxative flesh of cassina and tamarind, which is lacking in most of legumes?",
"Let us go further, and we will find certain organs, or the accidentals, which enjoy the same properties every time they are developed, regardless of the properties of the family;",
"thus, the tubers which are born on the fibers of certain roots, and which must be distinguished from the tumors due to simple bulge of a prominent stump, are all from the species of reservoirs full of sweet and nourishing starch, as one sees in potato, artichoke, spud, meadowsweet, etc.",
"2° If, on the contrary, the properties which we make the most frequent usage belong to some organ eminently essential to the family, we will find also that these properties offer little variations.",
"Thus the starchy perisperm of grasses is everywhere nutritive and has agreeable flavor;",
"the seeds of umbellifers which offer small vessels filled with essential oil are all stimulant and aromatic, etc.",
"3° If the same properties seem to be found in neighboring/related plants, but in different organs, one can, it seems to me, find the cause of this anomaly, by studying the relations of these organs most carefully.",
"This subject, which concerns vegetable anatomy, requires rather long development and maybe knowledge that botany has not yet acquired;",
"I would be content to cite some examples which could be useful.",
"When one examines the series of monocotyledon plants, one is surprised to see the bulbs of a great number of liliaceae providing starch almost like the trunk of palm trees, while some other bulbous roots have a purgative property analogous to that of the sap that aloe contains in its stem and leaves.",
"This resemblance between stems and bulbs, which can seem like an exception to the law which I have attempted to establish, is on the contrary to my eyes a confirmation;",
"vegetable anatomy proves, it seems, that the bulb needs not be assimilated to roots, but to stems:" ",
"I will explain.",
"In all bulbs, one distinguishes three parts:",
"the radicles which emerge from underneath of the bulb, and which are true roots;",
"the scales/peels or layers which envelop it underneath, and which are the aborted leaves;",
"an ordinarily flat and circular basal plate [disc] which, I think, is the stem of the plant;",
"I establish this opinion, 1° on that this disc carries, as we have seen it, the leaves on one hand and roots on the other, just like all true stems;",
"2° that it stretches/grows into the individuals of a same species, in such a way as to appear like a stem;",
"3° that the species that are evidently neighbors [congenères], such as certain garlics or antherics, offer a disc for some, a more or less elongated stump for some others;",
"4° that among liliaceae, we see bulbs only among the plants without stem, and reciprocally, 5° that certain seeds accidentally present the formation of a bulb due to the same cause, that is, withering of the interior part of the stem, which is thus found covered by the sheath of leaves;",
"6° that, if the bulbs were not the withered stems, one would see young, tender caïeu, not climbing, but descending like true roots." ",
"I will discuss further;",
"and I believe that, by absolutely similar arguments, one can prove that in all dicotyledons, there does not exist any plant truly without stem (acaulis), but that the stem exists stunted at the neck of the root, and that consequently what is called the scape must be integrated into peduncles and not to stems:",
"thus one will see how in the same family and in the same genera are found the plants called caulescentes and acaules;",
"one will see in particular, to move closer to my topic, how all plantains, chicaoraceae, a great number of legumes have the same properties, although distinct in appearance, by a character as singular as the existence or absence of a part as important as the stem.",
"We have until now examined the restrictions that the very structure of vegetables offers to the law of analogy between forms and properties;",
"it now remains to determine the influence of the circumstances in which vegetables are found at the time when it is customarily used.",
"Among the accidental circumstances, the most important one to examine is that which concerns the nature of terrain in which plant has grown.",
"Although the manner in which the soil influences vegetables is still not well-known, one cannot however be ignorant of its importance.",
"Théo. De Saussure has shown us that this influence extends much further than one believes, in remarking that the same plants born in the terrains of granite or limestone offer notable differences in their chemical composition and in their nutritive properties.",
"Physiologists’ attention on this subject was awakened too recently, for us to be able to draw from it direct consequences yet;",
"but we know more about the influence of soil in other respects:",
"thus, in certain families we see the properties of the same plants vary much, whether they grow in a dry place or in a humid soil;",
"heracleum sphondilium, a common plant in our prairies, and which different beasts ordinarily eat without difficulty, sometimes becomes poisonous, when it grows in a too humid place, or when the year is too abundant of rain.",
"We see likewise that bitter, foul-smelling, and poisonous celery—when collected from marshes where it grows naturally—becomes sweet and suitable for our food when it is cultivated in a dry terrain.",
"If the same species of umbellifers offers us similar anomalies, must we be surprised to see other plants of this family acquire in general a more or less poisonous property, when they grow in aquatic places, as in the case of phellandriam aquaticum, circula virosa, oethusa cynapium, oenanthe crocata, etc., while on the contrary those which grow in dry places, exposed to the sun, are more or less sweet, aromatic, and stimulating, such as: angelica archangelica, coriandrum sativum, anethum foeniculum, etc.?",
"According to the same observation, must one be surprised if the poisonous umbellifers are originated from cold or temperate countries, while those which grow in hot countries are aromatic and used as stimulants [?]",
"This influence of humidity, more or less great in soil, is felt in many other cases, and it is to this cause that the superiority of the plants collected on the mountains (to those same species gathered in the plains) is partly due.",
"This difference is further due to a second cause which powerfully modifies the vegetable products;",
"I would like to speak here of the more or less great quantity of light they receive.",
"The sun influences the properties of plants, by its heat, which removes from them excessive humidity, and by its light, which boosts carbon combination:",
"the union of these two effects always aims to exalt the properties of plants;",
"from this results two facts that seem contrary:",
"if the plants of one family are endowed with properties which require the perfect combination of elementary materials, such as umbellifers, one finds them all the more useful as they grow more exposed to the sun:",
"if, on the contrary, the juices of another family form bitter or harmful compounds by their acridness, one prevents these juices from reaching their perfection, either by using the plants in their youth, as is done for the family of asparagées [asparagus?] and chicoraceae, or by prolonging, so to speak, this youth by withdrawing light or etiolation;",
"it is what happens for many chicoraceae and cynarocéphales.",
"I take this occasion to remark how, in certain cases, the theory of natural families comes to the aid of vegetable physics, to explain certain visible anomalies produced by a same agent.",
"Independently of the influence of the sun and light, one can further observe that the very age of the plant influences its properties as well as the period in which it is harvested:",
"thus the meadow saffron is much more dangerous in spring than in autumn;",
"thus fruits enjoy very different attributes, depending on whether their maturity is more or less advanced.",
"These sources of errors are so striking that it suffices to state them here.",
"We have just surveyed different circumstances that the same structure of vegetables presents to us to explain the anomalies contrary to the theory.",
"Let us consider for an instant, under the same point of view, the chemical nature of plants:",
"just as there are constants and other more or less accidentals among botanical characters, among chemical characters in the vegetable kingdom there are also those which, like starch, resin, camphor, etc., are constant and fixed, and others which usually offer variations in proportion to their elements, and consequently in their properties;",
"in this latter class, I will cite particularly gum-resins, which one regards with much credibility as natural combinations of gum and resins.",
"According to this idea, one can understand easily that if gum on the one hand, and resin on the other, have different properties, as experience supports, gum-resins must have very diverse properties, depending on the proportions of these two elements;",
"and the observation shows us, in fact, that many of families in which we have remarked the most striking anomalies, abound in gum-resinous juices;",
"such are, for example, the families of umbellifers and morning glories:",
"one can further cite as an example the mixture of diverse principles, and consequently of different properties, those of immediate materials of vegetables, to which is given the names of extractive, of coloring material, of sap, etc.",
"Independently of the intimate combinations of certain principles, such as those whose examples we have cited, one often observes simple mixtures formed by the union of different principles well known to chemists.",
"Thus, many of our usual roots are composed of two very distinct principles, one sweet and nutritive starch, and the other more or less acrid and stimulating extractive material;",
"diverse proportions of these two principles give birth to, between very similar plants, rather singular anomalies:",
"thus in the genera arum, we find nutritive roots such as A. esculentum and colocasia, and acrid and corrosive roots such as A. maculatum;",
"one could cite as well cassava and bryony, which offer similar combinations.",
"One can still find the solution to some anomalies of chemical considerations of another kind:",
"one knows that among the immediate materials of vegetables, there are only diverse particular stages of a same substance;",
"thus the mucous body changes into sugar;",
"sugar seems to provide the elements of starch;",
"fixed oil transforms into wax, and volatile oil into resin, by the addition of oxygen, etc.",
"These diverse transformations whose extent we are still far from understanding can, in many cases, provide us with the means to understand how plants of the same natural family can offer us substances that are rather different in appearance:",
"thus certain conifers, instead of the completely formed resin, present us with volatile oil, that is to say, with the incompletely oxygenated resin;",
"thus rubber, which is produced by the juice of rubber tree, plant of the family of euphorbia, appears to end up in the juice of other euphorbiaceae, but in an incomplete stage:",
"one knows, in fact, that the juice of castor oil plant and that of many euphorbia, dried in the air, acquires a brown color, and conserves for some time rather remarkable elasticity.",
"We thus find in current chemical knowledge three means of explaining the anomalies that are observed in natural families, that is: the intimate combination of diverse elements, the mixture of different principles, and the more or less complete stage of each of them.",
"These considerations and many others which are under the immediate jurisdiction of chemistry, explain to us how the subtle differences in appearance in the mode of extraction and of preparation of medicines influence powerfully on their nature, and consequently on the visible properties of the plants from which the medicines are drawn.",
"But it is evident that there can exist an exact comparison between vegetable products only in the case where extraction and preparation of these products would have been sufficiently similar, not to alter or to equally alter their nature.",
"Could one, for example, draw any conclusion concerning the real properties of plants, from the nature that their juices would acquire after going through one of three types of fermentation[?]",
"This complicated manipulation connects the heterogeneous vegetable products such as palm tree, vines, currant bushes, apple trees, etc., while it can vary infinitely the products of a single species as the example of our grapes proves.",
"Many of the properties of certain vegetables, which appear to us to conflict with the laws of botanical analogy, demand that one apply particular conducts to these plants:",
"thus, before one attempted to extract distilled water from many species of rosaceae, could one regard the poisonous property of distilled water of cherry laurels as anomaly in nature?",
"We already see that a uniform maneuvering can discover, in analogous plants, similar properties that one was far from suspecting:",
"thus, Bernard de Jussieu, guided by analogy, discovered the seasoning of coffee bean in the seeds of galium aparine, prepared as those of caffeyer [coffee bush?].",
"Thus among the crustacean lichens, extreme diversity of colors extracted from them takes much less to the difference of coloring materials than to changes in maneuvering.",
"Diversity of preparation is an evident cause of errors, so I stop longer to develop it, and after having thus followed, that is to say, the formation of medicines, I will attempt to make precise the comparison of the very properties of drug substances used in medicine.",
"It should first be noted that, among the usages to which we have used vegetables, there are some which are absolutely independent of the nature of this vegetable, and on which the law of analogy can only have a very light, often absolutely no influence.",
"Thus, for example, when the carpenter uses horsetail(plant) to polish his works, or when bonnet-maker uses thistle to calf skin to get rid of bristles, it is evident that they employ for their purpose absolutely accidental circumstances in the economy of vegetable, which cannot easily be found in neighboring species;",
"thus, when the dog, pushed by its instinct, eats couch grass to vomit, one should not count couch grass as one of emetics, since, according to all appearance, it produces this effect on dogs only because this animal, equipped only with sharp teeth, cannot crush it, and in swallowing it half-chewed, it produces on the esophagus the same irritation as that caused when a feather hair is thrusted in human throat.",
"This example can help us see how, among the remedies used even for the interior, there are those that act with purely accidental circumstances.",
"As for those which produce their effect by mechanical causes, one can, among a great number of exceptions, recognize a certain influence of organization;",
"thus, for example, we have drawn from certain plants numerous usages, whether in domestic economy, or in medicine, that their soft, tough, and porous consistency makes suitable for easy, slow, and steady burning, and this consistence is found in many neighboring species:",
"thus most of big mushrooms can, in mature stage, make amadou and agaric for surgeons.",
"Thus the fibers of stems and leaves of a great number of compounds are used in diverse countries to manufacture the species of amadou that is used for moxa [burning herbs]:",
"such are scolymus and echinops in Spain, artemisia vulgaris [mugwort] in China, centaurea sibrica in Tartary, etc.",
"But these minute details do not merit more of our attention, and it suffices to have observed that the mechanical or accidental properties must be, in most of cases, excluded from our examination.",
"Although medical science rests almost entirely on physiology, one was obliged to classify medicines before having any precise idea of their action, and this vice of classification has not been absolutely abolished;",
"it has necessarily resulted from this that medicines were arranged not according to their characters/virtues, that is, their real action on animal fibers, but according to the effects that took place when one applied certain remedies to certain determined organ.",
"At the early stage, all remedies were almost regarded as specifics;",
"soon the discoveries of physiology and philosophical progress introduced in medicine led to generalization of the effect of medicines;"
"if now we still count the specifics among our usual drugs, if the action of medicines applied to the external body seems to bring to this theory, it must be agreed on the one hand that the number of these specifics has much diminished, and on the other hand, that the general progress of science seems to aim at diminishing it still further.",
"It would be outside of my subject to enter into any details on this delicate question:",
"I will remark only that from the accepted classification of medicines result two causes of errors concerning the question of botanical analogy applied to medicine.",
"1° One has often designated under two diverse names, and arranged in different classes the medicines whose action on animal fiber is very similar;",
"this error can relate to two causes.",
"Sometimes it is produced because certain medicines were for a long time applied to a single organ:",
"thus, evidently stimulant materials were found among the purgatives, emetics, diuretics, diaphoretics, emmenagogues, etc.:",
"moreover, the same medicines produce effects that are entirely different in appearance, when they are applied to different organs:",
"thus, tobacco provokes sneezing, stimulates the flow of saliva, emetic or purgative, depending on whether it is used to stimulate nose, mouth, esophagus, or intestinal canal.",
"Thus, depending on the circumstances where it is applied, scilla becomes purgative or emetic, diuretic or emmenagogue.",
"According to these examples where we see the same vegetable producing different effects, depending on which organ it is applied to, or on pathological state of the individual, should one be surprised if one sometimes finds plants which resemble each other by organization and which seem to have very different properties?",
"Thus, sound physiology is to compare these properties not according to their ordinary/usual effects, but in themselves.",
"Thus, when we see scilla sometimes emetic and sometimes emmenagogue, when we know for that matter that in these two classes of remedies, most act as stimulants, can’t we see how, without destroying natural analogy, that arum is emetic, while aristolochia, to which it is related, are emmenagogue?",
"Thus, can this same scilla, with its diverse properties, explain the apparent anomalies of the liliaceae family?",
"Does it not seem to participate on the one hand in purgative properties of aloes, and on the other hand in diuretic characters of garlic;",
"and can we not see in these medicines the simple modifications of the properties of stimulants?",
"Here are thus a new means for explaining anomalies—diverse application of one same virtue/character.",
"A second cause of errors, no less important to study, is the extreme diversity of the effects of a medicine given at different doses.",
"A cold bath begins by strengthening, and ends by weakening, if it is prolonged for a long time:",
"thus, everyone knows that wine in small dose is stimulant and tonic, and that, when taken in greater amount, it becomes narcotic and sedative.",
"One finds analogous diversities, although seemingly in opposite sense, in opium and probably in all medicines which increase or diminish the tone of temperament[le ton de la fibre].",
"If the same substance produces such diverse effects, depending on the dose it is used, should we not expect that the medicines drawn from analogous plants will produce different effects, depending on the greater or lesser concentration of principles?",
"If plant poisons act on human body only in quality of very powerful narcotics, and if we see several narcotics, taken in small dose, act as stimulant, can we be still surprised to find in the same families poisons and remedies, narcotics and stimulants?",
"If we reflect that in a selection of our foods, independently of nutritive quantity, we will also find a mild stimulant, to such an extent that when it is lacking we add it artificially, will we be surprised to see many plants which provide our food as placed next to the dangerous plants in the natural order?",
"This influence of the diversity of doses still tends to bring forward the virtues of certain medicines.",
"Thus, one knows that rhubarb flushes out like a stimulant, and acts like a tonic on a mild dose.",
"Dock plants in our climates, on the same dose as rhubarb, acts only as a tonic;",
"likewise, among morning glories, we find jalap extremely purgative, while mechoacan is simply tonic, etc.",
"2° We have observed how, whether by diversity of morbific cases or diversity of doses, the medicines with truly analogous characters produce different effects;",
"it remains now for us to examine a last source of errors, which is that the truly different medicines produce similar effects.",
"There is almost no class of medicine in which one does not find the examples of this phenomenon.",
"Thus, although the increase of urines through the diuretics seems to be a very simple effect, it is however produced by three different means—by simple increase of the mass of liquid in human body, or because kidneys are especially excited, or because the entire system is stimulated:",
"aqueous fruits, foxgloves, and scilla seem to offer us the examples of these three classes of diuretics.",
"Looking at the diaphoretics, one would find likewise that some only increase the quantity of liquid to evaporate, others give more activity to circulation, some stimulate the vessels, others elevate the body temperature;",
"that the sole purpose is to mechanically unclog the orifice of pores, and that many act by the combination of several of preceding manners.",
"Let us further observe the general effect of the purgatives;",
"we will see many of them which stimulate the intestinal canal, others that seem to on the contrary relax or lubricate it, and some which, like manna, seem to flush out by simple indigestion, etc.",
"If we find diverse causes for producing effects that are so constant, so proven, and so simple as those we have just enumerated, what would it be like if we move onto more complicated and less known effects?",
"What would it be like, if we examine the alexipharmaques [counteractives to poison], attenuants [blood thinner], inspissants [thickening agent], vulnerarius, and many other properties that are little known, unclear, and whose effects can be produced by many diverse causes?",
"But if it is well demonstrated that the same effect can be produced by very different causes, should we not, in our discussion, pay little attention to effects, and much to the mode of action for each medicine?",
"This observation further leads to destroying one of more powerful objections against the analogy of forms and properties, namely that the plants of very different orders produce effects in similar appearance.",
"It seems to me that until the mode of action of each drug is exactly known, this objection is of little force.",
"Thus, when we see rubiaceae, apocineae, etc. serve indistinctly as emetics, can we insure that their manner of acting on fiber/temperament is similar, and until then, can we draw some certain conclusion against the theory that I have developed earlier?",
"Here the second part of this dissertation ends.",
"We have traced the principal rules that the current state of botany, chemistry, and medicine presents to us for comparing with exactitude the properties of plants;",
"and each of them, instead of increasing the number of exceptions, has provided on the contrary the solution for many anomalies:",
"if I am not mistaken, it is in general a rather sure mark of truth of a theory to see it become more established as one applies to it more scrupulous exactitude.",
"I will now apply the principles and laws that I have posed, not by limiting myself to the families conforming to the theory that I have shown, but by enumerating successively what one knows about the general properties of each natural family."

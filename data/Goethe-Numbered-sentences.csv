"If one studies plant growth, it is easy to see that certain external parts of the plant undergo transformations, and pass on to the state of the adjacent parts, sometimes fully, sometimes partially.",
"Thus, for example, most of the single flowers become double-flowers, when petals that are completely identical to other petals of the corolla in form or in color, or those that still retain the visible marks of their origin, develop in place of the stamens and anthers.",
"If we observe that, from this manner, it is possible for the plant to take a step backward and reverse the order of growth, we will become all the more aware of the regular course of Nature, and we will learn to understand these laws of metamorphosis, according to which a part of the plant develops through another,"" offering the most varied forms by the modification of a single organ.",
"Naturalists have been generally aware for some time that there exists a hidden relationship among different external parts of the plants, such as leaves, calyx, corolla, and stamens, which develop one after the other and one out of the other;",
"one has even investigated it in details, and the phenomenon by which one and the same organ appears in such diverse forms has been called the metamorphosis of plants.",
"This metamorphosis appears in three manners: regular, irregular, and accidental.",
"The regular metamorphosis can also be called progressive:",
"the metamorphosis is observed, from the first cotyledons to the final development of the fruit, as gradually and constantly developing, and which, as in a spiritual ladder, reaches by passing from one state to another, the most elevated term intended by Nature, that is, the propagation by the two sexes.",
"It is the metamorphosis that I have attentively studied for several years, and which I seek to explain in this essay.",
"In the demonstrations which follow, however, we will limit ourselves to considering only the annual plant which develops continuously from seed to fructification.",
"We could also call the irregular metamorphosis by the term of retrogressive;",
"while in the preceding case Nature hastens towards her great goal, here she takes one or more steps backwards.",
"In the previous case, Nature produces the flowers with an irresistible force and by a powerful effort, and she prepares them for the work of love;",
"in this case, on the contrary, Nature declines and leaves her creation in a weak, indeterminate state, often pleasing to the eyes but internally deprived of force and action.",
"It is here that we will find the opportunity to discover, by observations of this kind of metamorphosis, what the regular development hides from us, to see clearly what we can only infer from it;",
"and it is thanks to this process that we can hope to attain our goal with most certainty.",
"On the other hand, we will leave aside the third kind of metamorphosis, the accidental, produced by the external causes, in particular by the insects, since it distracts us from the simple path that we must follow and from our goal.",
"Maybe we will find elsewhere the opportunity to discuss these monstrous excrescences, but which are however rather limited.",
"I have attempted to write this essay without referring to the detailed illustrations, even though under certain aspects they might seem necessary.",
"I will reserve their publication until later;",
"this can be done more easily, as there still remain sufficient materials to develop and expand this short and preliminary treatise.",
"It won’t be necessary then, to observe a measured tread in the present work.",
"I will be able to add some other analogous subjects, and the passages extracted from the authors who agree with our goal will be included.",
"In particular, I won’t neglect to make use of all the works of the contemporary authors, who grace this noble science.",
"It is to them I present and dedicate these pages.",
"As we intend to observe the successive steps of the growth of the plants, we first direct our attention to the plant at the moment of developing from the seed.",
"At this stage we can recognize easily and clearly the parts which belong to it.",
"It leaves its coverings more or less under the earth, which we will not examine for the moment, and often, when the root toughens up in the soil, it brings outside the first organs of its upper growth, which are already covered by a sheath.",
"These first organs are known by the name of Cotyledons.",
"They have also been named the seminal leaves, nuclei, seed lobes, etc. to express the different aspects under which we find them.",
"They often appear unformed, filled with a crude material, as thick as they are long, their vessels unrecognizable and hardly distinguishable from the whole substance.",
"These Cotyledons look almost nothing like a leaf, and we can be misled to consider them as separate organs.",
"But in a great number of plants, they are more like the state of the leaves;",
"they become flatter and take up a more pronounced green color, when exposed to the air and the light, their vessels becoming more distinct and more similar to the ribs of a leaf.",
"Finally, they appear as the true leaves;",
"their vessels are capable of the most delicate development, and their resemblance to the succeeding leaves does not allow us to consider them as separate organs;",
"we recognize them more as the first leaves of the stem.",
"Thus, if one cannot imagine a leaf without a node, and a node without an eye, we must conclude that the point where the cotyledons are attached is the true first node of the plant.",
"This opinion is reinforced by the plants which push the new eyes directly under the wings of the cotyledons and which develop full branches from this first node, as, for example, in Vicia Faba.",
"The cotyledons are usually double, and this leads us to an observation which will be more important later;",
"the leaves which accompany this first node are in pairs, while the following leaves of the stem alternate.",
"One thus discovers here that the parts are associated and connected, which nature later separates and scatters.",
"The fact is still more remarkable when the cotyledons appear as several small leaves around a single axis and, from its center, one sees a stem gradually develop and produce later leaves singly;",
"this can be observed more clearly in the development of different kinds of pines.",
"Here a crown of needles is formed as a quasi-calyx and we will remember this when we encounter similar cases later.",
"We will not examine for now the unformed individual nuclei of the plants which sprout only with a single leaf.",
"On the contrary, we will observe that even the most leaf-like Cotyledons are always less developed, compared to other leaves of the same stem.",
"Their contour is particularly very simple and one finds there little traces of serrations as the hairs on their surface or other vessels that are particular to the full leaves.",
"We can study with as much exactitude the successive development of the leaves, now that the gradual action of nature is fully visible to our eyes.",
"One or even more leaves that follow are already frequently present in the seed and are enclosed between the Cotyledons;",
"they are known in this folded state under the name of plumule.",
"In several plant, their form appears different from that of the cotyledons and the later leaves, but they most often differ from the cotyledons in that they are flat, delicate, and generally formed as true leaves, as much as they turn completely green, lie on a visible node, and leave no doubt for their affinity to the other leaves of the stem;",
"but they usually present an inferior development of their periphery, since their edges are not developed to their full extent.",
"But further development spreads without interruption from node to node through the leaf, as its central rib lengthens and the side ribs develop more or less towards the edges.",
"The different states of these ribs in relation to one another are the principal cause of the various forms of the leaf.",
"Thus, it appears as serrated, profoundly notched, composed of several small leaves, and in the latter case, it becomes similar to a small full stem.",
"The date palm gives us a striking example of these successive variations of the simple leaf, developed to the highest degrees.",
"The central rib advances forward through a series of leaves, the simple fan-like leaf being torn apart and divided;",
"and it produces a highly refined leaf, which rivals the form of a full stem.",
"The leafstalk also develops in the same manner as the leaf, whether the leafstalk is immediately attached to the leaf or forms a distinct, easily separable organ.",
"We observe in several plants that this leafstalk, which forms a distinct part, tends to take on the form of a leaf, as in the example of the orange family;",
"and its organization will raise more observations, which we will not examine for now.",
"Likewise, we cannot stop here to make special observations of the stipules;",
"we will only note in passing that they share in the later transformation of the stalk, above all when they constitute a part of the leafstalk.",
"Just as the leaves receive their initial nourishment principally from the more or less modified aqueous parts which they draw from the stem, they also owe must of their development and refinement to the air and light.",
"If the Cotyledons, produced under the seed covering and filled with crude sap, seem hardly structured or only in an incomplete way, the leaves of the plants that grow underwater, too, are imperfectly structured in comparison to those which are exposed to the open air.",
"The same species of plants, when they grow in a lower and humid place, produce more supple and less developed leaves;",
"whereas it will develop hairy and more refined leaves in higher regions.",
"In the same manner, the anastomosis of the vessels, which produce the skins of the leaf by starting from the central rib and connecting by their extremities, is, if not entirely caused by, at least strongly related to the very rarefied gases.",
"When the leaves of several plants which grow underwater are threadlike or take the form of antlers, we are led to attribute it to an incomplete anastomosis.",
"The growth of Ranunculus aquaticus shows this in an evident manner.",
"Its leaves, when grown underwater, consist of threadlike ribs, and those which grow above water develop, on the contrary, the shared surface that unifies the ribs and are in a complete state of anastomosis.",
"One can even clearly observe the transition in the half threadlike and half anastomosed leaves of this plant.",
"Experiment/experience has shown that the leaves absorb different gases which are combined with the liquids they contain;",
"it is beyond doubt that they return these refined juices to the stem and thereby lead to the development of the nearby eyes.",
"The gases contained in the leaves of several plants or in the cavities of the hollow leaves/stems have been analyzed, and one could thus acquire a certainty in this regard.",
"We observe in several plants that a node emerges from another.",
"This is obvious in the stems which are closed from node to node, like the cereals, grasses, and reeds.",
"It is not as obvious in other plants whose stems are completely empty and filled with pith or rather a cellular tissue.",
"The importance of this substance, previously called pith, has been disputed for good reasons (footnote: Hedwig, Leipzig Magazine, no.3), and the influence it seemed to exert on growth has been denied, attributing to the internal part of the second bark named liber all the force of growth and development;",
"we can be assured that an upper node, since it derives from the preceding one and indirectly receives the juices from it, must obtain more refined and purified sap, and that, benefitting from the influence of the earlier leaves, it can grow with greater perfection, bringing to its own leaves and eyes a more refined sap.",
"As the coarser saps are eliminated, as more refined saps replace them, and as the plant develops step by step, it reaches the point prescribed by nature.",
"We finally see the leaves in their maximum growth and development, and we prepare to observe a new phenomenon, which tells us that the stage we have been dealing with is over, that the next stage is near, that is, that of the flowering.",
"The transition to the flowering state occurs sometimes quickly or sometimes slowly.",
"In the latter case, one normally sees that the stem leaves begin to shrink, to lose peripheral indentations, while on the contrary, towards the base, where they join the stem, they somewhat expand;",
"at the same time we see that, if the interval between two nodes does not lengthen in a noticeable manner, at least the stem appears more delicate and slender, compared to its preceding state.",
"It has been observed that abundant nourishment hampers the transition to the flowering stage, and that moderate, even meager nourishment accelerates it.",
"It even more clearly showcases the effect of the stem leaves which we discussed earlier.",
"As long as there are coarser juices to refine, the organs of the plant must serve as instruments for this purpose.",
"When there is a surplus of nourishment, this operation must always repeat, thereby rendering the flowering impossible.",
"When plant lacks nourishment, nature’s operation is curtailed and facilitated.",
"The organs of the nodes are refined, the effect of the refined saps is purer and more powerful, the transformation of organs become possible, and the process is uninterrupted.",
"This transformation often proceeds rapidly;",
"in this case, the stem, from the node of the last leaf, becomes at once more elongated and more refined;",
"and it joins several leaves around an axis at its end.",
"One can prove in the most evident manner that the leaves of the calyx are exactly the same organs which appeared as the stem leaves, but which are reorganized now around a common center and often in varying forms.",
"We have already noted earlier regarding the Cotyledons a similar effect of nature, and we have seen several leaves, even several nodes, united around a same point and brought closer to one another.",
"The species of the pine family show from their development from the seed a rayed circle of unmistakable needles, which are already well developed, unlike other cotyledons.",
"Thus, we already see in the first stage of this plant the mark of nature’s power, which must produce the flowering and fructification in an advanced stage.",
"One further observes in several species of flowers the unmodified stem leaves collected below the flower in the appearance of a calyx.",
"It suffices, as they conserve the integrity of their form, to rely on their appearance and on the botanical terminology, which designates them under the name of floral leaves, Folia floria.",
"We must give attention to the case already cited, where the transition to flowering proceeds slowly, where the stem leaves come together gradually, modifying themselves and slipping into the calyx;",
"it is easy to observe in the calyxes common to the compositae flowers, in particular sunflowers and calendulas.",
"This power of nature, which joins several leaves around an axis, appears to create a closely clustered union and make these modified and clustered leaves unrecognizable, since it joins them together sometimes in entirety and sometimes in part, and make their edges merge.",
"These delicate leaves mutually push against and contact one another so closely, anastomose through the purest juices accumulated in the plant, and produce the bell-shaped or single-leaf calyxes, which, through their incisions and divisions, clearly reveal their composite origin.",
"We can see this by comparing a certain number of calyxes that are deeply incised with multi-leaved ones, particularly by observing closely the calyxes of certain composite flowers.",
"Thus we see, for example, that a calyx of a calendula, described systematically as simple and indented, is composed of several raw leaves together, against which, as we have already noted earlier, the leaves contracted from the stem have come to rest.",
"In many plants, the leaves of the calyx around the common axis, whether individual or merged together, just as the organs which succeed them, are constant in number and form.",
"The growth, stability, and glory of botanical science rely greatly on this constancy.",
"In other plants, the number and form of these parts are not as constant;",
"but the sharp eyes of the masters of science could not be misled by this irregularity, they even sought to impose tighter limits on these deviations of nature by a precise terminology.",
"It is thus that nature produced the calyx by uniting together several leaves and nodes towards a central point, in a determined order and number, that elsewhere it would have produced one after another and at a certain distance between them.",
"If flowering had been prevented by excessive nourishment, these parts would have been separated and appeared in their original form.",
"Consequently, nature, in forming the calyx, does not produce any new organ, but she unites and modifies the organs that are already known, and thereby takes a step closer to her goal.",
"We have seen that the calyx is developed through a purified juice which is produced gradually within the plant, and that it thereby becomes, in its turn, the organ of a greater refinement.",
"This is already made convincing through the simple mechanistic effect of the calyx.",
"Indeed, how delicate and appropriate for the finest filtration must be these tightly contracted vessels we have seen?",
"We can note in more than one ways the transition from the calyx to the corolla;",
"although the calyx may usually be still green, similar to the stem leaves, the color of some parts often changes at the tip, edge, backside, or even on the inner surface, while that of the outside still remains green;",
"and we see that there is always a relation between the refinement with this coloration.",
"From this results the ambiguous calyxes that could be also considered as corollas.",
"Likewise, we have observed that the stem leaves go through a great expansion and development from the seed leaves, especially at their periphery, and then up to the calyx they contract in their contour;",
"also likewise, we note that the corolla will be newly produced by expansion.",
"The leaves of the corolla are normally bigger than the calyx leaves, and one can observe how the organs which had been contracted in the calyx now develop as petals and produce the new, differentiated organs, highly refined by the purest juices that are further filtered by the calyx.",
"Their refined organization, color, and fragrance would make their origin unrecognizable, if we were not in a position to get at Nature's secret in several extraordinary cases.",
"It is thus, for example, that one sometimes finds a second calyx inside the calyx of a carnation, which, in part perfectly green, indicates the tendency to produce a single-leaf, incised calyx, whose jagged tips and edges develop into a true beginning of the delicate, expanded, and colored petals, where we can clearly recognize the relationship between the corolla and the calyx.",
"The relationship between the corolla and the stem leaves is also shown in more than one ways;",
"one can observe in several plants the stem leaves already more or less colored, long time before flowering;",
"others become fully colored in this period.",
"Sometimes Nature passes directly to the corolla and skips over the organ of the calyx, where we have the opportunity to observe the stem leaves turning into petals.",
"Thus, for example, an almost fully formed and colored petal appears on a tulip stem.",
"This case is even more remarkable, when the green half of this leaf remains attached to the stem, while its other, colored half rises up as part of the corolla, thereby dividing the leaf in two.",
"It is probable that color and fragrance of petals are attributable to the presence of the pollen.",
"It is probably still imperfectly differentiated, sometimes combined and diluted in other juices;",
"the beautiful appearances of colors lead us to conclude that the substances that fill the leaves are of great purity, but not yet of the highest degree, which would appear white and colorless.",
"This point will appear still more probable, when we consider the close relationship between the petals and the stamens.",
"If the relationship of other parts were striking, if it were generally acknowledged as undeniable, this essay would be superfluous.",
"In some cases, Nature shows us this transition in a regular form, as, for example, in the Canna and several other plants of this family.",
"A little modified true petal contracts at the upper border and produces an anther, with the rest of the petal serving in place of the filament.",
"We can observe all steps of this transition in the flowers which frequently become double.",
"In several species of roses, at the center of the fully formed and colored petals, other petals are formed which are contracted either in middle or at sides;",
"this contraction is caused by a small callus, which appears more or less in the form of a true anther, while the petal itself likewise assumes the simplified form of a stamen.",
"In some double poppies, the fully developed anthers rest on a scarcely modified, completely double corolla;",
"in other species, the petals are more or less contracted by the anther-like callus.",
"If all stamens metamorphose into petals, the flowers will be sterile;",
"but if the staminiferous organ develops even in a double flower, fructification can occur.",
"Thus, a stamen is produced when the organs, which expanded to form the petals, contract tightly and appear in a highly refined state.",
"The observation that we have made earlier is thereby reinforced, and we notice more and more this alternating force of expansion and contraction, by means of which Nature reaches her goal at last.",
"No matter how rapid the transition from the corolla to the stamens takes place in some plants, we can however observe that Nature cannot always achieve this in a single step.",
"It produces the intermediary organs which sometimes resemble one part in form and function, and sometimes another;",
"and although their structure may vary greatly, almost all of them can be considered as the organs of a slow transition from the leaves of the calyx to the stamens.",
"Most of the diverse organs which Linnaeus named the nectaries fall under this concept;",
"and we have an opportunity here to admire this extraordinary man’s insight, who, without a clear idea of the purpose of these parts, followed his intuition and gave the same name to the organs in diverse appearances.",
"Several petals already show their similarity to the stamens, in that, without a noticeable change of the form, they carry a kind of cavities or glands which secrete a honey-like juice.",
"According to the earlier discussion, we can suppose to a certain extent that it is a fluid of fructification, although imperfectly differentiated, and this hypothesis will be further justified by the discussions below.",
"Finally, these organs called the nectaries show a special/independent character, which sometimes look like the petals and sometimes the stamens.",
"Thus, for example, the thirteen filaments with the same number of red balls at the end, on the nectaries of Parnassia, have the greatest resemblance to the stamens.",
"Others appear like the filaments without anthers, as in Valisneria and Fevillea;",
"we also find them in Pentapetes, in leaf forms, which form a whorl by regularly alternating with the stamens;",
"they are also indicated in the systematic descriptions under the name of Filamenta castrata petaliformia.",
"Kiegellaire and Passiflore offer the same examples of these unclear developments.",
"Thus the internal/secondary corollas seem to merit the name of nectaries, in the sense indicated earlier.",
"While the formation of the petals is caused by expansion, on the contrary, the internal/secondary corollas are produced by contraction, in the same way as the stamens.",
"Thus we can observe inside the fully formed corollas the development of smaller, contracted secondary corollas, as in the case of Narcissus, Nerium, and Agrostemma.",
"We further see still more striking and remarkable changes in the leaves in diverse kinds of plants.",
"We observe in different flowers that their petals, in their lower interior, have a small hollow filled with a honey-like juice.",
"This small cavity, deeper in other species or genera of flowers, creates on the back of the petal a horn- or spur-like projection, and the rest of the petal is more or less modified at the same time.",
"It is what can be observed close up in the different species and varieties of the columbine.",
"One finds this organ greatly transformed in the Aconite and Nigella, where one can however still recognize its similarity to a leaf with a bit of attention;",
"in Nigella, in particular, it easily passes to the leafy state and the flower becomes double by the transformation of the nectaries.",
"By looking with attention at the Aconite, one will recognize the similarity between the nectaries and the arched leaf which covers them.",
"Since we just stated that the nectaries are the transitional forms from the petal to the stamen, we can make some observations on the irregular flowers.",
"Thus, for example, the five external petals of Melianthus are considered as the corolla, but the five internal petals as a secondary corolla composed of six nectaries, whose upper part is closer to the leafy state, and the lower part, already named the nectary, is least like it.",
"In the same sense, one could give the name of nectary to the carina of the papilionaceous flowers, for, among the petals of these flowers, it is most similar to the structure of the stamens and, on the contrary, least like the leaf of the vexilla.",
"In this manner, we could easily clarify the nature of these penicillate (brush-like) bodies which are attached to the extremity of the carina of some species of the Polygala, and we get a clear idea of the purpose of these parts.",
"It would be useless to defend seriously against the idea that the goal of these observations is to confuse the distinctions and classifications done by the observers and taxonomists;""'",
"our wish is only to clarify the extraordinary formation of plant organs by means of these observations.",
"The microscopic observations have shown beyond doubt that the reproductive organs of plants are produced as others by the spiral vessels.",
"We use the argument to prove the inner identity of different plant parts which appear in such varied forms.",
"If thus the spiral vessels rest in the bundles of sap vessels and are enclosed by them, it is possible to form a clearer idea of this strong contraction of organs, by representing these spirals, which look like springs, as extremely strong, so that they prevail over the expansion of the sap vessels.",
"Thus, these shortened bundles can no longer expand, join one another, and form a network by anastomosis;",
"the tubular vessels, which fill the spaces of the tissue, can no longer develop;",
"all the causes by means of which the stem leaves, calyx, and flower acquire their expansion disappear entirely now, and a weak, simplest filament is formed.",
"The fine membranes of the anther can still be barely produced, in the middle of which the most delicate vessels are terminated.",
"If we admit now that the same vessels, which first grew longer, enlarged, and joined one another, are in a highly contracted stage; if the fertile pollen emerges from them, which replaces by its activity the expansive force that is now lost to the vessels which produced the pollen; if, finally, this entirely independent pollen searches out the feminine organs, which by a similar action of nature are accrued at the top of the pistils; if the pollen attaches to them and transmit its influence; then we are led to name this union of the two sexes an anastomosis on a spiritual level, and we think, at least in a moment, that we have brought the concepts of growth and reproduction closer together.",
"The fine production which is developed in the anther appears in the form of a pollen;",
"but these tiny grains are merely the vessels which contain the most purified juices.",
"We therefore share the opinion of those who think that this fluid is absorbed by the pistils to which the grains are attached, and that thereby fructification takes place.",
"This opinion seems all the more true, as some plants don’t produce pollen at all but only a liquid material.",
"This reminds us the honey-like juice of the nectaries and its probable relationship to the developed fluid of the seminal grains.",
"Maybe the nectaries are merely the preparatory organs, maybe their honey is extracted by the stamens to be completely developed there and to take a definite character;",
"this idea seems all the more plausible, as this juice is no longer observed after fructification.",
"Let us remark in passing that the filaments, as well as the anthers, join together in more than one manner, and we offer the most marvelous examples of these anastomoses and union, which we have frequently discussed, of the plant organs which were strictly separate at first.",
"After having attempted to make as clear as possible that the plant parts, developed after one another in various forms, are the same in their origin, one can easily assume that I intend to explain in the same manner the structure of feminine organs.",
"Let us consider first the style apart from the fruit, as one often finds it in nature;",
"we can do this all the more easily, since it is distinct from the fruit in this form.",
"In fact, we note that the style is placed in the same stage of growth as the stamens.",
"We can observe that the stamens are produced by a contraction;",
"It is often the same for the styles, and we see them, although not always of the same size as the stamens, in only a little longer or shorter forms.",
"In several cases, the style almost looks like a filament without the anther, and the similarity of their external development is greater than in other parts.",
"Since they are produced by the spiral vessels in both cases, we see clearly that the organs of the two sexes are not separate organs, and if this observation shows their close relationship, the idea of calling their union an anastomosis appears more appropriate and evident.",
"We often find the style composed of several other styles grown together, and the parts composing it are hardly recognizable at the tip, where even they are not always separated.",
"This growth by mergence, which we have noted several times, is here more likely than in other stages;",
"this must take place, for these delicate parts are pressed against one another at the center of the blossom before their full development, and can thus unite with each other in the most intimate manner.",
"Nature shows us in the regular cases, more or less clear indication of the close relationship between the style and the previous parts of the flower.",
"Thus, for example, the pistil of the Iris with its stigma appears as the complete structure of a petal.",
"The umbrella-shaped stigma of the Sarracenia is composed of several leaves, although not in as striking manner, but it remains green.",
"With the help of the microscope, we find several stigmas, such as the Crocus and the Zannichellia, which are formed as full single-leaf or multi-leave calyxes.",
"Nature often shows us the retrogressive cases, where she transforms the styles and stigmas back into petals;",
"thus, for example, the Ranunculus asiaticus becomes double, since the stigmas and the pistils of the bract are transformed into true petals, while the stamens immediately behind this corolla are not altered.",
"Some other remarkable cases are presented below.",
"We recapitulate here the observations which we have discussed above, that the styles and filaments are in the same stage of growth, and thereby we explain again the principle of alternate expansions and contractions.",
"We observed first an expansion from the seed to the perfect development of the flower of the stem, and from there we saw the calyx produced by a contraction, the petals by an expansion, then again, the reproductive organs by a contraction;",
"we will soon note the greatest expansion in the fruit, and the greatest contraction in the seed.",
"It is in these six stages that Nature completes without rest the eternal work of the reproduction of plants by the two sexes.",
"Now we are to observe the fruits, and we will be soon convinced that they derive from a same origin and conform to the same laws.",
"Here, we are in particular speaking of the receptacles that Nature produces to cover the seeds, or rather, to develop a more or less great number of seeds inside them by the union of the sexes.",
"Few words suffice to show that these capsules are explained by the nature and structure of the parts that have been discussed until now.",
"The retrogressive metamorphosis reminds us of this law of Nature.",
"Thus, in the carnation, so well-known and sought for its irregularity, one often observes that the seminiferous capsules are transformed back into the leaves similar to a calyx, and that the styles belonging to them are proportionally shortened;",
"We even find the carnations in which the silique is converted into a full calyx, whose divisions at the tip still show the delicate traces of the style and the stigma, and inside this second calyx, a number of more or less full petals develop instead of the seeds.",
"Moreover, Nature reveals this fertility hidden in the leaf by the regular and continuous formations.",
"Thus, the modified, but still very recognizable leaf of the lime tree carries on its midrib a stalk with its full flowers and fruits.",
"In the Ruscus, the manner in which the flowers and fruits rest on the leaves is still more remarkable.",
"The fertility of the stem leaves is evident in a striking manner in the ferns, which, by means of an inner impulse, and maybe without positive action of the sexual organs, develop and distribute on the leaves an enormous quantity of seeds, or rather the germs for growth;",
"the fecundity of a single leaf here rivals that of the mature plants, or a big tree with numerous branches.",
"Having presented these observations, we will certainly not neglect the form of the leaf in these seed capsules, apart from their varied forms, their mutual relations and their special purposes.",
"We will recognize, for example, the pod as a leaf folded on itself and grown on its edges;",
"the husks consist of some leaves grown over one another;",
"the compound capsules can be explained by several husks united around a central point, half-opened and joined by the edges of contiguous husks.",
"In fact, we can see this with our own eyes;",
"when the similar capsules burst apart after maturation, each of their parts appears as an open pod or a husk.",
"Even in several species of the same genus, a similar effect takes place regularly;",
"for example, the fruit capsules of the Nigella orientalis are in the form of a half-open pod, while in the Nigella damascene their union appears complete.",
"Nature hides this resemblance to the leaves by producing the soft and juicy capsules, or solid and woody ones.",
"But she cannot mislead us, if we master the art of following carefully all her intermediary transitions.",
"It suffices here to have given a general concept by some examples, and to have indicated the consistency of her progression.",
"The great variety of the capsules will later give us the material for more observations.",
"The relationship between the seminal capsules and the parts which preceded them is again revealed in the stigma, which in several cases rests immediately above the capsules and is inseparably attached to them.",
"We have already indicated above the relationship between the stigma and the leafy state, and we can present it here again, for one notes in the double poppies that the stigmas of the capsule is transformed into small, colored, delicate petals, entirely similar to the small leaves.",
"The last and the greatest expansion produced by the plant in the course of its growth is in the fruit.",
"It is often very big and even monstrous, either in terms of its inner impulse, or of its external structure.",
"This final expansion takes place after fructification, and the developing seed seems to absorb the juices of the entire plant for its growth, which is directed towards the pericarp, so that this organ is nourished, grows, and expands excessively.",
"From the earlier discussions, we can conclude that the purified gas contributes to this phenomenon and the pure air sealed inside the pods of Colutea confirms it.",
"On the other hand, we find that the seed is produced by the highest degree of contraction and of inner development.",
"One observes in diverse species of the seeds that they transform the leaves to into their immediate covering, more or less adapt them to themselves, and even powerfully annex them and change their form entirely.",
"As we saw previously, several seeds are produced from a single leaf, which serves as their covering, and we are not surprised to see an individual embryo covered with a leaf covering.",
"We find the traces of the incompletely adapted leaf organs in several winged seeds, as, for example, in those of the maple, the elm, the ash, and the birch.",
"The calendula’s three distinct circles of varied seeds offer a remarkable example of the way the embryo pulls together and gradually adapts the bigger coverings to its shape.",
"The outer circle conserves a form analogous to that of the calyx leaves;",
"only the rudimentary seeds curve the leaf by swelling their rib, while the internal curve is divided into two parts by a delicate membrane running lengthwise.",
"The next circle is already much changed, the broad leaf and membrane have entirely disappeared;",
"on the contrary, its structure is somewhat elongated, the rudimentary seeds on the back become more distinctive, and the small raised spots which cover them become more visible.",
"These two circles do not appear to have been fructified or only partially.",
"Thus comes the third internal circle, where the seeds are found in their true, strongly curved state, with an involucre, which is fully developed in all its ridges and raised portions.",
"Thus, we see once again here a powerful contraction of the leafy parts, by the vital inner force of the seed, as we have seen previously the petal contracted by the power of the anthers.",
"Thus, we have followed as carefully as possible the footsteps of Nature;",
"we have accompanied the external form of the plant in all its transformations and developments, from the seed to the formation of a new seed, and without pretending to uncover the basic impulses of Nature, and we have directed our attention to the expression of the forces by which the plant gradually shapes one and the same organ.",
"To not lose the sight of the thread we have understood, we have considered in passing the annual plant, limited ourselves to note the metamorphoses of the leaves which accompany the nodes, and derived all forms from them.",
"But to give this essay the necessary thoroughness, one must speak of the eyes, which remain hidden beneath each leaf, and which develop in certain circumstances and seem to disappear entirely in other circumstances.",
"Each node receives from nature the power to produce one or several eyes;",
"it is produced near the accompanying leaves, which appear to prepare the formation and growth of the eyes and contribute to their production.",
"The slow, simple process of plant reproduction rests on the successive development of a node from another, of a leaf from each node, and of an eye nearby.",
"It is known that such an eye is similar in effect to the mature seed, and that it is often easier to recognize in the eye than in the seed the entire structure of the plant which would emerge from it.",
"Although it is not so easy to note the root point in the eye, it is however as much present there as in the seed, and this point develops easily and promptly, above all in the presence of moisture.",
"The eye does not need the cotyledons because it is already connected to the mother plant and thereby receives sufficient nourishment from it, or, when separated from the mother plant, from the plant to which it is grafted, or from the roots which are produced as soon as an offshoot is planted in the earth.",
"The eye is composed of a certain number of more or less developed nodes and leaves, which must serve to propagate the plant;",
"thus the lateral stems which emerge from the nodes of a plant can be considered as small plants located on the mother stem, in the same way that the parent is attached to the ground.",
"Their differences and relations were already often studied, but in particular in these recent times, in such careful and perspicacious manner that it suffices to refer to it here in full admiration (footnote: Gaertner, De fructibus et seminibus plantarum, Cap.1)",
"We only cite what follows.",
"Nature clearly differentiates the eyes and the seed in fully developed plants.",
"But if we consider the less developed plants (with less differentiated structure,) then the difference which exists between them disappears even for the most skilled observers.",
"There are seeds that are not clearly seeds, and gemmae that are not clearly gemmae;",
"but the connection between the seeds which are truly fertilized by the action of the two sexes, isolated from the mother plant, and the gemmae is not recognizable by the senses but by the reason.",
"This considered, it must be concluded that the seeds, which differ from the eyes by their inner structure and from the gemmae by the apparent cause of their formation and separation, are closely related to both the eyes and the gemmae.",
"We have sought to explain, by the transformation of nodal leaves, the state of simple flowers, as well as the production of the seeds which are contained in the capsules, and a more attentive examination shows us that, in a similar case, the eyes do not develop or moreover that the possibility of such development is almost none.",
"But we feel it necessary to look at the development of the eyes to explain the formation of composite flowers, as well as the compound fruits arranged around a single cone, a single spindle, or a single disk.",
"We observe very often that some stems, which do not prepare long time beforehand and concentrate their forces for a single flower, push the flowers from each of its nodes and continue this process uninterrupted until their tips.",
"But the theory which we have discussed earlier explains the phenomena.",
"All flowers which develop from the eyes must be considered as complete, whole plants attached to the mother plant, just as the latter is attached to the ground.",
"As they receive from the nodes a purified sap, the first leaves of this branch are already more advanced in development than the first leaves of the mother plant which follow from the cotyledons;",
"consequently, sometimes a calyx and a flower are formed immediately on the branch.",
"These very flowers which develop from the eyes would become stems with abundant nourishment, and would share the fate of the mother stem.",
"As these flowers are developed from node to node, we can also observe each change of the leaves, as we have seen earlier in the gradual transition to the calyx.",
"They contract more and more, against one another, and end up disappearing altogether.",
"As they become more less different from the leaf form, they take the name of the Bracts.",
"The stem likewise diminishes in size, the nodes crowd closer together, and all other phenomena previously observed take place, and if the flower is possibly produced only at the tip of the stem, it is because Nature has already exercised her prerogatives from node to node.",
"We have observed a stem with a flower at each node, and it will be easy to form a clear idea of the composite flower, above all if we recall what we have earlier said about the formation of the calyx.",
"Nature forms a calyx of several leaves that she pushes together and unites around a single axis;",
"it is by means of this powerful force of plant that she produces the composite flower, by shrinking an endless stem, by arranging all its eyes in the state of flowers, compacted against each other on a common disk, and each small flower fertilizes the seed vessel already prepared below it.",
"The nodal leaves are not always lost entirely in this incredible contraction;",
"the leaflets faithfully accompany each small flower which, in thistles, develops from the eyes next to it.",
"One can compare this to the form of the Dipsacus laciniatus.",
"In several species of grasses, each flower is also accompanied by a such leaflet which takes the name of glume.",
"We will see in this manner how it is evident that these seeds produced by a composite flower are nothing other than the eyes developed and brought to its completion by the reproductive process.",
"With this concept firmly in mind, we observe diverse flowers by comparing them to each other, and their examination will increase our certainty.",
"It will no more be difficult to explain now the formation of the covered or uncovered seeds, which are produced in the center of a single flower and which are often found crowded around a common spindle;",
"for it is all the same, whether a single flower contains a group of seeds and the pistils merge together and absorb the juices from the anthers to infuse them into the seeds, or each seed has its own anthers and petals around its pistil.",
"We are certain that with some practice, it won’t be difficult to explain in this manner the varied forms of flowers and fruits;",
"the only requirement is that one must be comfortable with the previously established principles on the expansion and contraction, compaction and anastomosis, as with algebraic formulas, and know how to apply them.",
"The exact observation and comparison of the different stages that Nature works through, whether in the formation of the genera, species, varieties, whether in the growth of each plant, are crucial;",
"for this, a collection of sketches with an application of the botanical terminology to different parts of the plant could be pleasant and useful.",
"Two examples of the proliferous flowers, which are relevant to the theory we have discussed, will serve as decisive illustrations.",
"The example of a proliferous rose shows us in the clearest manner all we have sought to conceive with the help of imagination and understanding.",
"The calyx and the corolla are arranged and developed around the axis, but one does not see the seed vessel and the reproductive organs are not found on or around it;",
"one sees, on the contrary, the stem, half reddish and half greenish, develops;",
"the small, folded, and dark red petals, some of which carry the traces of the anthers, develop successively around it.",
"The stem continues to grow;",
"already the new thorns begin to appear, the individual colored petals that follow become smaller and passes to the state of the half-red and half-green leaves;",
"finally, a series of regular nodes is formed, and from their eyes, the small but imperfect rose buds emerge once again.",
"This example again provides a clear proof for our previous argument, that all calyxes are merely the floral leaves contracted together on their border.",
"In fact, the regular calyx around the axis consists of five completely developed leaves, with three or five leaflets, the same as what the stems of the roses carry at their nodes.",
"After having studied this phenomenon carefully, another phenomenon in the proliferous carnation may seem still more remarkable.",
"Here, we see a perfect flower, with its calyx containing a double corolla, also having at the center a well-defined seed capsule, although still not completely developed.",
"On the sides of the corolla, four new perfect flowers develop, which are separated from the mother flower by the stalks with three or more nodes.",
"They likewise have calyxes, are likewise double, not so much by individual leaves as by leaf crowns merged at the base, and above all by the petals which are merged like the small branches around the stem.",
"Despite this incredible development, one still finds in some the pistils and the anthers.",
"The capsules with the styles are visible and the seed vessels are grown back into the leaves:",
"in some of these flowers, one even found the arils (seed envelopes) joined together in a perfect calyx and containing all the necessary rudiments for producing a new complete double flower.",
"If we saw in the rose a partially defined flower, a stem still emerging at the center and new leaves developing around it, now we find in this carnation, with a well-formed calyx and a perfect corolla, the eyes which develop from the circle of petals on the seed capsule truly central to fertilization, and which produce true stems with flowers.",
"These two cases demonstrate that Nature usually terminates the growth with the flower, precluding the possibility of infinite growth, to hasten toward its goal by the formation of the seeds.",
"If I have stumbled here and there on the path which one of my predecessors had tried, under the guidance of his illustrious master, and described as very difficult and dangerous (footnote: Ferber, Dissertationis secundae de Prolepsi Plantarum), and if I have not sufficiently paved the way and cleared the difficulties for my successors, at least I hope that my efforts won’t be absolutely fruitless.",
"It is now time to take into consideration the theory that Linnaeus proposed to explain these phenomena.",
"The observations that the present essay indicates could not have escaped his scrutinizing glance, and if it is possible for us now to progress where he faltered, we owe it to the united efforts by great number of observers and thinkers who have paved the way and dissipated a certain number of prejudices.",
"A detailed comparison between his theory and the one we have discussed would take up too much time here.",
"The knowledgeable persons will conduct this by themselves with ease;",
"but it would require too much effort to clarify it for those who have not considered this subject yet.",
"We will be content with noting briefly the causes which prevented Linnaeus from going further and achieving his goal.",
"At first, he observed the trees, those complex and long-lived plants.",
"He remarked that a tree, receiving excessive nourishment in a big pot could continue several years of producing branches one after another, and that the same tree in a narrower pot quickly bore flowers and fruits.",
"He saw that the successive development concentrated itself to a fast and simultaneous progression.",
"It is why he named this operation of Nature the Prolepsis or Anticipation, since the plant leaping the six stages that we have discussed above, seemed to take six years beforehand.",
"And thus, he deduced his theory from the tree buds, without having paid particular attention to annual plants, for it was easy to note that it would not apply as well to them.",
"In fact, according to his view, one must admit that Nature really intended each annual plant to grow for six years, and that the plant forestalled this long term by flowering, bearing fruits, and dying.",
"We have on the contrary followed the growth of the annual plant;",
"from this, it is easy to apply to the plants that live longer, for a bud appearing on the trunk of the aged tree can be considered as an annual plant, although it develops from a trunk that has been formed for a long time and may itself last for a long time.",
"The second cause which prevented Linnaeus from going further comes from the fact that he considered the different concentric parts, superposed on each other in the plant body—the external bark, the inner bark, the wood, the pith—as equal in their effect, and as endowed with the same degree of life and importance;",
"he also attributed the formation of flowers and fruits to these different rings of the trunk, for the latter, like the former, envelop and develop out of one another.",
"But this observation was only superficial and could not stand a more scrupulous examination.",
"Thus, the external bark was not suitable to yield further growth, and in the long-lived trees, it came to be too hardened and too separate on the outside, just as the wood becomes too hard towards the center.",
"It falls away in several trees, and one can peel it without causing the least damage;",
"thus, it cannot produce a calyx, or any other living part of the plant.",
"The inner bark is the part that contains all the forces of growth and life, and if it is more or less damaged, the growth will suffer accordingly;",
"a careful observation shows that it brings growth gradually throughout the plant, in the stem or producing flowers and fruits.",
"Linnaeus attributed to it only the secondary function of producing the petals.",
"On the contrary, he attributed the essential formation of the male organs to the wood;",
"while one can easily note that the wood itself is in a state of rest due to its solidification, and it must be considered as a part deprived of vital action, even if durable.",
"Finally, the pith was to fulfill the most important functions by producing the female organs and abundant offspring.",
"The doubts that one raised on the great importance of the pith, the reasons on which they were based, seem significant and conclusive.",
"The idea that the style and the fruit developed from the pith was merely an illusion, since these organs, when they emerge, are found in a parenchymatous, soft, indefinite state similar to the pith, and are gathered together in the center of the stem, where we usually only see the pith.",
"I hope that the present essay can shed light on the metamorphosis of plants, contribute to deciphering this enigma and lead to further remarks and conclusions.",
"The observations on which it is based were made singly at different times, and are also collected in order (footnote: Batsch, Anleitung zur Kenntniss und Geschichte der Pflanzen, Part I, Chapter 19);",
"and one will soon be able to see whether the steps that we have taken bring us closer to the truth.",
"Let us recapitulate as briefly as possible the principal results of this essay.",
"Let us observe a plant in terms of the manifestation of its vital forces, we see them operate in two different manners, first by growth which produces stems and leaves; then by reproduction which culminates in flowers and fruits.",
"Let us observe the growth more closely, and we see that, as the plant continues from a node to another, from a leaf to the next one, it produces at the same time a reproduction which differs from the reproduction by flowers and fruits, which operates all at once, while the former takes place successively and appears as a series of individual developments.",
"This vegetative and gradual force is closely related to the force that performs a great reproduction all at once.",
"One can, in different ways, make a plant grow continuously, or on the contrary, make it bloom.",
"The former took place when the underdeveloped juice of the plant is formed in great quantity;",
"the second took place when the more rarefied juices predominate.",
"By qualifying that vegetative growth is successive, and flowering and fruictifying are simultaneous, we are already describing the manner they take place.",
"A plant which grows more or less expands, and develops a stem or branch, and the intervals between nodes are usually perceptible and its leaves spread out on all sides.",
"A plant which flowers, on the contrary, contracts in all its parts, the dimensions of length and breadth are canceled out, and all its organs are in a highly concentrated state, lying next to one another.",
"Whether the plant grows, flowers, or carries fruits, it is however always the same organs which fulfill Nature’s intentions with diverse fates and often in varying forms.",
"The same organ, which expanded on the stem as a leaf in most diverse forms, contracts in a calyx, expands in petals, contracts to produce the stamen, and expands one last time to produce the fruit.",
"This action of Nature is at the same time connected to another, the union of diverse organs around a center in set numbers and proportions;",
"but in several flowers, it is often much modified, enlarged, or diminished in particular circumstances.",
"An anastomosis also likewise influences the formation of the flowers and fruits;",
"it is by this that the delicate parts of the fructification, crowded against each other, merge in the most intimate fashion, whether for the whole time of their existence, or for part of it.",
"The convergence, centering, and anastomosis are however not unique only to flowers and fruits, and we can even recognize something similar in the cotyledons;",
"and other parts of the plant will provide us with rich materials for the observations of this kind.",
"We have sought to derive the diverse organs of the plant in its state of growth and flowering from a single organ, the leaf, which normally develops at each node;",
"we have also sought to relate to the leaf the fruits which completely cover their seeds.",
"It is obvious that we would need a general term to indicate the different states of the metamorphosed organ and to thus compare their diverse forms:",
"but we must be content here with relating these forward and backward phenomena.",
"Thus, we can say: a stamen is a contracted petal;",
"a sepal is a contracted stem leaf with a certain degree of refinement, just as we can say that a stem leaf is an expanded sepal, produced by excessive crude juice.",
"One can likewise say of the stem that it is an indefinitely expanded state of flowering and fructification, just as we have concluded that the flowers and the fruits are a contracted stem.",
"Furthermore, I have taken into consideration at the end of this essay the development of the eye, and thereby I sought to explain the composite flowers as well as the uncovered fruits.",
"Thus, I have tried to present a view that seems convincing to me, in as complete and clear way as possible.",
"If however it lacks evidence, if there still arise some objections, and if the explanations do not equally apply to all cases, I will be obliged to take further notes of all observations, and to treat this material in a more precise and detailed manner, so that this exposition would become more evident and obtain a generally more favorable reception than at present.",

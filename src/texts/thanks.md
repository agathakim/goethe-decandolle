This project would not have been possible without the support from my advisor, Professor Robert J. Richards, and the VUE (Visualization for Understanding and Exploration) team at the University of Chicago. The visual components and their presentation on this website are all thanks to Kazutaka Takahashi and Siraj Elahi on the VUE team. This work was completed in part with resources provided by the University of Chicago Research Computing Center.

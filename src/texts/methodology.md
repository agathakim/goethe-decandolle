This case study is composed of three sets of comparisons (the icons on the left side of this page direct to different sets of comparisons.) Each set compares Goethe’s text (Metamorphosis of Plants, originally published in 1790 but translated and introduced to the French audience after 1829) to one of the three botanical texts by De Candolle (Essai sur les propriétés médicales des plantes [1804], Essai élémentaire de géographie botanique [1820], and Organographie végétale, Book V, Chapter II [1827]). Goethe and De Candolle put forward very similar morphological concepts in botany, but faced contrasting receptions by the French audience.

The visuals presented in these sets of comparisons show the “thought-components” of each botanical text. What kind of thoughts—whether they be logical, descriptive, philosophical, etc. in nature—are present in each text, and in what ratios? How does each category of thought-components interact with other categories? What can the visual and numerical findings tell about the character of each text—and does this character neatly correspond to the widespread nineteenth-century assumptions about that text?

To answer these questions, I propose to visualize each botanical text, adopting the following steps:

Every sentence in a given text is tagged with one or more of the “thought-component” categories. I use seventeen of these categories, which are listed below, with example sentences from Goethe and De Candolle that are tagged with a given category. (In the visuals, each thought-component category is represented by a colored block.)
Once every sentence of the text is tagged, then these categories are ranked from those that occupy the most space of the text to those occupying the least space. (At the very bottom of each visuals page, I provide the same large table, which shows the overall rankings of the categories for all four texts that are being compared.)
After the tagging process, it is possible to represent each botanical text visually: each sentence is simply converted to a string of color blocks, which represent different thought-component categories. The whole text then becomes a large collection of color blocks. By placing side by side a collection of color blocks representing Goethe’s text and another collection representing each of De Candolle’s texts, one will easily understand which are dominant colors that build each text. This is what I call the first-level interactive visuals, which are at the top of each visuals page.
Beyond understanding which thought-component categories are most and least used to form a botanical text, I further examine which categories tend to be tagged together—or, which pairs or triples of categories tend to work together when defining each sentence. The outcomes are again visualized, which I call the second-level interactive visuals, and they are presented below the first-level visuals. I also provide the numerical tables that summarize the visuals.
